### Are There Any Features That Cannot Be Experienced When Using SwitchBot Safety Alarm on My Android Phone?

When using the safety alarm on an Android phone, you cannot access two features:
1. You cannot check the location of the safety alarm when it is outside the Bluetooth range. To use this feature, please add it to Apple's "Find My" app.

2. The anti-malicious tracking feature is not available as it relies on Apple's network and is only accessible on iOS devices.

### How Can Parents Receive SOS Notifications from SwitchBot Safety Alarm Their Child Is Carrying?

The Safety Alarm connects to the SwitchBot app via Bluetooth. When the pin is removed, an emergency SOS alert is sent through our server directly to your phone. To ensure you receive these important notifications, please keep your phone within Bluetooth range of the Safety Alarm, and allow the SwitchBot app to run in the background.

To ensure parents receive emergency SOS notifications from the Safety Alarm carried by their child, please check the following:  
Add the Safety Alarm to the SwitchBot app.  
Follow on-screen instructions to set up an email address for receiving notifications by going to SwitchBot app → Safety Alarm → SOS Emergency Alert.
Give your child a smartphone.
Install the SwitchBot app on your child's smartphone and log in with the same account and password used by parents.

Note:  
Parents and children can each create their own SwitchBot app accounts and utilize the Home Sharing feature, allowing notifications to be sent to the homeowner, administrators, or members.
