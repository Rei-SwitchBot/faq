### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot Won’t Enter Dark Carpet Areas

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The S20 is equipped with highly sensitive cliff sensors designed to ensure your robot’s safety by preventing falls. These sensors are so precise that they may occasionally recognize dark-colored carpets as a drop, triggering the fall-prevention function and causing the robot to stop working on those areas. While we work on a permanent solution, we can offer a temporary workaround to help maintain uninterrupted cleaning.
You can use the SwitchBot App to mark the dark carpet areas, allowing the S20 to continue cleaning those zones without interruption. Here’s how you can set it up:
- Open the SwitchBot App.
- Tap your S20 robot.
- Tap the map icon in the center-left of the screen.
- Go to "Edit Floor".
- Select "Carpet Cleaning" and then "Carpet Settings".
- Mark the areas with dark-colored carpets.
Important Note:
When you mark dark-colored areas for cleaning, the cliff sensor sensitivity will decrease. If you have staircases or other potential hazards nearby, we recommend setting those areas as "No-Go Zones" instead of marking them as dark carpet areas to prevent accidents.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding as we work towards a permanent solution. If you need further assistance or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

### Daylight Saving Time with SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S20

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?

As an alternative, if you are running a full-house clean, you can use SwitchBot’s automation feature to schedule this. Please note that automation currently does not support selecting specific rooms for cleaning.
Our R&D team is actively working on this and exploring ways to improve scheduling for future updates. Thank you for your understanding, and please don’t hesitate to reach out with any additional questions or feedback.

### Can I Use the Auto-empty Station from SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 with the S20?

Regarding the compatibility between Floor Cleaning Robot S10 and S20, please refer to the following information:  
1. The S10 cannot be used with the base station of the S20.
2. When docking the S20 with the auto-empty station of the S10, charging is possible (requires auto-empty station firmware V23 or later), but functions like waste collection and mop drying are not available.
3. Both robot models, S10 and S20, can utilize the water station. If you upgrade to the S20, you can designate the water station from your S10 for use with the new model.

Where to buy the water station: [https://www.switch-bot.com/products/s-series-water-station](https://www.switch-bot.com/products/s-series-water-station)

Important Note:
