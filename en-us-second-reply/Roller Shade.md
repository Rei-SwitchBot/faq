### Can I Use SwitchBot Curtain Solar Panel for My Roller Shade?

It depends on the model of the solar panel you have:
Curtain 3 Solar Panel: Not compatible. The Curtain 3 solar panel has a foldable design that, when connected to the Roller Shade, would face the window at a right angle, limiting its exposure to sunlight and making solar charging ineffective.

Older Model Curtain Solar Panel: Compatible. You can use the older version of the Curtain solar panel with the Roller Shade. To ensure proper installation, attach the solar panel securely using 3M double-sided adhesive tape (not included)
