### Can I Use SwitchBot Curtain Solar Panel for My Roller Shade?

It depends on the model of the solar panel you have:
Curtain 3 Solar Panel: Not compatible. The Curtain 3 solar panel has a foldable design that, when connected to the Roller Shade, would face the window at a right angle, limiting its exposure to sunlight and making solar charging ineffective.

Older Model Curtain Solar Panel: Compatible. You can use the older version of the Curtain solar panel with the Roller Shade. To ensure proper installation, attach the solar panel securely using 3M double-sided adhesive tape (not included)

### Is It Possible to Purchase the Fabric for SwitchBot Roller Shade Separately?

Currently, we do not have plans to sell Roller Shade fabric separately, and we strongly recommend  choosing and purchasing fabrics at a market near your home.
When choosing your shade fabric, remember:
1. Fabric Roll Diameter: The diameter of the rolled-up fabric, including the rod, should not exceed 66mm.
2. Fabric Weight: Keep the fabric weight under 3kg to avoid putting too much strain on the Roller Shade and affecting its performance.
