### Is It Possible to Change the CO2 Value on SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) Screen to Other Temperature and Humidity Data?

Currently, the top section of the Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)'s screen is dedicated to showing the CO2 level, and this cannot be changed to display other values. In comparison, the SwitchBot Meter Pro allows you to display different temperature and humidity data on the top and bottom sections of its screen. However, please note that this model does not include a CO2 sensor.

### Is It Possible to Change the CO2 Value on SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) Screen to Other Temperature and Humidity Data?

We’re happy to let you know that when you connect your SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) to a SwitchBot Hub, you can use the CO2 level as a condition in SwitchBot Automations. This allows you to trigger other SwitchBot devices based on the CO2 readings.
Note: Starting with SwitchBot App version 9.0, there is no longer a need to manually enable the Cloud Service (the Cloud Service option has been removed). Simply place the Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) near the Hub, within Bluetooth range, and it will automatically connect to the Hub.

### Batteries and Charging Adapter for SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)

SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) is powered by two AA alkaline batteries, which typically last for about one year.  We do not recommend using rechargeable batteries, but if you choose to use them, please ensure that the combined voltage of both batteries does not exceed 3V, as this could potentially damage the device.
SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) can measure from -20°C to 80°C.  However, we recommend using batteries in all SwitchBot products within a temperature range of 5°C to 45°C. Extreme cold or hot environments are not suitable for battery use. In low temperatures, battery efficiency decreases, which can result in insufficient power. High temperatures can cause the battery to react more intensely, leading to rapid discharge or even risks such as leakage or swelling.
In addition to battery power, your SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) can also be powered using a 5V 1A adapter and a Type-C charging cable. This provides you with a convenient alternative to keep your device running without relying solely on batteries.
Note: Charging adapter is not included in the package.

### How to Manually Calibrate the CO2 Level of SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)

1. Make sure your SwitchBot App version is up to date.

2. Make sure your Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) has been added to your App.

3. You can calibrate the CO2 level in the following order.
- Launch SwitchBot App and log in.
- Tap your Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) .
- Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- Tap "Calibrate" on the settings screen.
- Tap "CO2 Monitor".
- Follow the on-screen instructions and place your Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) in a well-ventilated area for 1 minute and then tap "Calibrate".
Note:
The calibration process will take 5 minutes. Please refrain from moving your device during this time.
Calibration can only be performed within the Bluetooth range of the Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor).

### Update Frequency of CO2 Readings on Switchbot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)

When powered by batteries, the CO2 value updates every 30 minutes. You can see a timer located slightly to the right of the center of the screen, counting down to the next update. If you'd like to manually refresh the CO2 data, you can press the button on top of the device or tap the "Refresh" button next to the CO2 value in the SwitchBot App.
When using a 5V 1A adapter and Type-C cable for power, the update frequency automatically switches to every 1 minute. You can also customize the update frequency in the SwitchBot App. Please note, when the update frequency is set to less than 1 minute, the CO2 sensor is continuously active, which may cause the device to heat up slightly and affect the sensor's accuracy.
Way to set up data update interval:
SwitchBot App -> Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) -> Gear icon -> Panel Display -> Data Update Interval -> CO2

### How Much Data Can Be Stored With SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)?

SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) can store data for up to 36 days. If this time frame is exceeded, the oldest data will be replaced with new data.
When connected to our hub, temperature and humidity data will be saved on a server, enabling a Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) to retain data for a maximum of 2 years.

---
### Does SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) Have a Magnet Like the Meter Plus Has?

Due to their larger size and heavier weight, the SwitchBot Meter Pro and CO2 Monitor do not include built-in magnets or a magnet plate. Unlike the Meter and Meter Plus, these devices are not designed to be attached to metal surfaces like a refrigerator, and we do not recommend using them in this way.


---
### Difference Between Using SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) Alone and with a Hub

When you use the SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) by itself, it communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This means you can view temperature and humidity and CO2 data in the SwitchBot App as long as your phone is within Bluetooth range of the device. However, when you leave the Bluetooth range, the device will appear offline in the app, and you won’t be able to check the data remotely.
When you pair the Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) with a SwitchBot Hub, the Meter will automatically connect to the network as long as it is within the Bluetooth range of the Hub (SwitchBot App V9.0 or newer required). This allows you to check temperature and humidity and CO2 data anytime and from anywhere through the SwitchBot App, even when you're not at home. Additionally, with the Hub, you can use the Meter’s data as a condition for SwitchBot Automations, triggering actions for other devices based on the temperature or humidity levels.

### Does SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) Have a Built-In Backlight?

SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) does not have a built-in backlight. Adding a backlight could generate heat, which may affect the accuracy of the temperature and humidity readings. We understand this may be an inconvenience, and we apologize for any frustration this might cause.

### What Does the Button on the Top of SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) Do?

### What to Do if the Cable Included with SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) Is Too Short for My Needs?

If the cable included with your CO2 Monitor is too short, you can use the 2-meter charging cable that comes with the SwitchBot Hub 2. However, please note that when you use this longer cable, the temperature and humidity measurements will be taken from the temperature and humidity sensor built into the Hub 2's charging cable, not from the CO2 Monitor itself. 
We're happy to provide this charging cable at no charge. Since it ships from our Hong Kong warehouse, a shipping fee (which varies by destination) will apply. If you'd like to request a cable, please contact us and we'll provide a shipping quote.
