### Why Is There No Service Plan for SwitchBot Pan Tilt Cam Cloud Storage Subscriptions with Over 3 Devices?

The traditional camera series products do not offer a cloud storage plan for three or more devices. You can mix and match by purchasing 1 unit, 2 units, or 3 units as needed. For instance, if you have 10 indoor cameras, you cannot subscribe to a single cloud storage plan for all of them. Instead, you can choose to subscribe to a combination plan of 3 cameras, 3 cameras, 3 cameras, and 1 camera. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and kindly ask for your understanding.
