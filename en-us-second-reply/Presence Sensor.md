### Can I Install SwitchBot Presence Sensor on the Balcony?

Please do not use the Presence Sensor outdoors or on balconies as air flow, glass reflections, and hanging clothes can interfere with the sensor and affect its performance. Also, if the temperature in the operating environment is too high, PIR detection may not work properly.
