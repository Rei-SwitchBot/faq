### Can I Install SwitchBot Presence Sensor on the Balcony?

Please do not use the Presence Sensor outdoors or on balconies as air flow, glass reflections, and hanging clothes can interfere with the sensor and affect its performance. Also, if the temperature in the operating environment is too high, PIR detection may not work properly.

### Can I Install SwitchBot Presence Sensor in My Bathroom?

The Presence Sensor can be installed and used in toilets or bathrooms. Normally, even if some water splashes and droplets land on the Presence Sensor, it will not affect the device. However, please do not submerge the device in water.
Note:
The Presence Sensor is not equipped with a camera lens and microphone, so it will not capture images, record sound, or take videos. There is no need to worry about privacy from this perspective.

### How Long Can SwitchBot Presence Sensor Batteries Last?

If the Presence Sensor detects movement 10 times a day, with each detection lasting 30 minutes, its two AAA batteries will last approximately two years.
Note:
The above estimates are based on SwitchBot laboratory test conditions and may differ depending on actual usage environments.

### Can I Use Rechargeable Batteries to SwitchBot Presence Sensor?

Due to unstable voltage, please do not use rechargeable batteries with the Presence Sensor.

### Can SwitchBot Presence Sensor Be Used without a Hub?

If you want to use the Presence Sensor to trigger other devices with SwitchBot automation, you will need to purchase one of our hub products. However, even without a hub, you can still connect directly to devices like Bots, Curtains, and Color Bulbs using Bluetooth communication. Feel free to use the Presence Sensor as needed.
Note:
Up to 2 local linkages can be created.
Each local linkage can be configured for only one device, multiple device triggers are not supported.

### How to Enable Push Notifications for SwitchBot Presence Sensor

1. If you would like to receive notifications from the Presence Sensor, you will need to purchase our hub product and add both devices to the SwitchBot app.
2. Starting with SwitchBot App version 9.0, there is no longer a need to manually enable the Cloud Service (the Cloud Service option has been removed). Simply place the Hub near your device, within Bluetooth range, and it will automatically connect to the Hub. The connection status can be checked by going to SwitchBot app -> Profile -> Manage Hubs -> Tap the appropriate hub.
3. Turn on notifications for Presence Sensor in the following order:

### Will the Cats and Dogs at Home Affect the Detection of SwitchBot Presence Sensor?

Dogs and cats, which have body temperatures similar to humans, may trigger motion detection by the Presence Sensor when they run around the house, causing it to determine its status as "space-occupied". To avoid such situations, we recommend installing the Presence Sensor upside down (with the pairing button facing downwards as shown in the diagram).

### What Is SwitchBot Presence Sensor's Unoccupied Timer?

The "Unoccupied Timer" of the Presence Sensor refers to the duration of time when a person leaves the sensor detection range, and the state of "Space Unoccupied" continues.
You can set this timer for anywhere between 5 seconds and 3 minutes by going to SwitchBot App → Presence Sensor → Gear Icon → Detection Settings → Unoccupied Timer.
If the "Unoccupied Timer" setting is too short (e.g. 5 seconds), it may mistakenly switch to "Space Unoccupied" when someone is still present. Conversely, if set too long (e.g. 3 minutes), it will take a certain amount of time to reach "Space Unoccupied", but accuracy is high and mistakes are less likely. It is recommended to set the timer at 15 or 30 seconds for optimal use in different scenarios.
"Space Unoccupied" can be used as a SwitchBot automation condition to trigger other devices. We use setting the "Unoccupied Timer" time to 3 minutes as an example to explain the specific logic of automation triggering.
When: Space unoccupied for longer than 1 min
Perform: Turn off Color Bulb
When we leave the detection range of the presence sensor and after a preset "unoccupied timer" time of 3 minutes, it meets the condition of "Space unoccupied". In addition, after another 60 seconds, the Color Bulb will automatically turn off. Which means under this automation, the Color Bulb  will automatically turn off in at least four minutes.
Please note that the shorter the set time of the "Unoccupied Timer", the faster the battery consumption rate. We appreciate your understanding!

### How Many Luxes of Brightness Can SwitchBot Presence Sensor Detect?

SwitchBot Presence Sensor can detect brightness up to 1000 lux, and the illumination level is approximately 20. In the SwitchBot app, it is displayed as illumination levels from 1 to 20 instead of in lux units.

### When Should I Use the Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity Function of SwitchBot Presence Sensor?

The "Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity" feature in the Presence Sensor works by having the device record energy variations across different distances within its detection range. Based on these readings, it automatically sets an appropriate detection threshold. When a person enters the area, the energy level at the corresponding distance increases. If it exceeds the set threshold, the sensor will recognize this as motion detection (space-occupied).
If you change the installation location of the sensor or rearrange the room layout, we recommend running the "Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity" feature again. This allows the sensor to recalibrate and adapt to the new environment, ensuring it continues to work accurately.
You can use this feature by going to SwitchBot app → Presence Sensor → Gear icon → Detection Sensitivity → Auto Adjust.
