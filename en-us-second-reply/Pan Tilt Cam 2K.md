### Why Is There No Service Plan for SwitchBot Pan Tilt Cam Cloud Storage Subscriptions with Over 3 Devices?

The traditional camera series products do not offer a cloud storage plan for three or more devices. You can mix and match by purchasing 1 unit, 2 units, or 3 units as needed. For instance, if you have 10 indoor cameras, you cannot subscribe to a single cloud storage plan for all of them. Instead, you can choose to subscribe to a combination plan of 3 cameras, 3 cameras, 3 cameras, and 1 camera. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and kindly ask for your understanding.

### Why Is There No Service Plan for SwitchBot Pan Tilt Cam 2K Cloud Storage Subscriptions with Over 3 Devices?

The traditional camera series products do not offer a cloud storage plan for three or more devices. You can mix and match by purchasing 1 unit, 2 units, or 3 units as needed. For instance, if you have 10 indoor cameras, you cannot subscribe to a single cloud storage plan for all of them. Instead, you can choose to subscribe to a combination plan of 3 cameras, 3 cameras, 3 cameras, and 1 camera. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and kindly ask for your understanding.

### How to Check the MAC Address of SwitchBot Pan Tilt Cam 2K

If you are using an Android smartphone, you can check the MAC address by connecting the camera to the smartphone's personal hotspot.
The method for connecting to a personal hotspot on an Android phone may vary depending on your device. Let's use a HUAWEI device as an example.  
Go to Settings → Mobile Network → Personal Hotspot to view the device name and password. Turn on the Personal Hotspot to start using it.  
Once connected, go to "Connected Devices" under the personal hotspot menu on your smartphone to find the MAC address of the camera.

If you are using an iOS device, the only way to check the MAC address is to connect the Pan/Tilt Cam 2K to an Android device or a PC running Windows 10 or later, as there is no 'Connected devices' option when using iPhone tethering. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
