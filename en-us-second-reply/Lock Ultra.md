### How to Install the Magnet of SwitchBot Lock Ultra

1. The detectable parts of the magnet are located on both sides. When installing the Lock Ultra vertically, refer to the diagram below for the correct installation distance. Attach the side of the magnet with the grey marking or opposite side to the door frame, facing the Lock Ultra dial knob.

<img width="566" height="701" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/413e52c6-ce71-4ce6-8708-d0994bbf5f74" />

2. The side with double-sided tape and the opposite side are undetectable. If either of these sides faces the Lock Ultra, it may not accurately recognize if the door is open or closed. Depending on your environment, you can attach spare tape to the magnet's side and install it on surfaces like a door frame.
