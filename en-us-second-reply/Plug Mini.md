### Troubleshooting the power calculated by multiplying current by voltage doesn't match the power displayed on SwitchBot app

The power factor cosφ may vary depending on the home appliance being used, so it is recommended to verify this information with the manufacturer. If the wattage does not align with the formula of voltage x current x power factor cosφ after checking the power factor, please provide us with both the power factor and the manufacturer of the appliance so that our technical team can investigate further.
