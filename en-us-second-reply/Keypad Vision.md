### Is It Possible to Disable the Indicator Light on SwitchBot Keypad Vision?

Currently, it is not possible to turn off the indicator on the Keypad Vision. We apologize for not being able to meet your request at this time, but we will review this matter internally and work towards an improvement in future firmware updates.
If the Keypad Vision is set to automatic activation, the indicator light may turn on due to passersby. As a temporary measure, please configure the settings by navigating to SwitchBot App -> Keypad Vision -> Gear Icon -> Face Entry Settings -> Trigger Face Recognition -> Manual or Custom.

Note: 
The iPhone Wallet app allows you to add ICOCA, Suica and PASMO in Japan. The above illustration is for ICOCA, but the method to turn other transportation cards into express transit card is the same.
There are currently no compatible European or American transit cards in the SwitchBot Lab data. As a temporary solution, you can add a Japanese transportation card in the Wallet app to achieve smartphone attachment Keypad Vision unlocking.
