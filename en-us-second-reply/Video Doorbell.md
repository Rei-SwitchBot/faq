### Troubleshooting the Video of the Doorbell Has Been Loading Continuously, Unable to View from the Monitor.

Thank you for reporting this issue. 
We apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please try the following to see if there is an improvement.

1. Turn off the router, move the monitor closer to the doorbell, and try using it to play back the doorbell's video. If you can't move the monitor, consider moving the router.
2. Turn on the router and position it closer to the doorbell so that your home's entrance is within Wi-Fi range.

Points to enhance the doorbell Wi-Fi connection:
- Move the router closer to the doorbell to reduce obstructions such as walls and metal objects.
- Place the router in a higher location to spread the Wi-Fi signal.
- Use an extender to receive and expand the existing Wi-Fi signal.

If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Important Note: When using the device without Wi-Fi, keep the doorbell and monitor within 5 meters for a stable connection.
