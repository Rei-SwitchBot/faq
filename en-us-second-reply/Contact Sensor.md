### How to Enable Push Notifications for SwitchBot Contact Sensor

1. If you would like to receive notifications from the Contact Sensor, you will need to purchase our hub product and add both devices to the SwitchBot app.
2. Starting with SwitchBot App version 9.0, there is no longer a need to manually enable the Cloud Service (the Cloud Service option has been removed). Simply place the Hub near your device, within Bluetooth range, and it will automatically connect to the Hub. The connection status can be checked by going to SwitchBot app -> Profile -> Manage Hubs -> Tap the appropriate hub.
3. Turn on notifications for Contact Sensor in the following order:
- Launch the SwitchBot app and log in.
- Tap "Profile" at the bottom right.
- Tap on "Preferences".
- Tap on "App Notifications".
- Turn on "Device Notifications".
- Tap on "Notification Management" below device notifications.
- Switch to the Home where the Contact Sensor is located at the top left.
- Tap on the corresponding Contact Sensor.
- Enable "Allow Notifications".
- Enable the necessary notification items.

4. You can turn off notifications in the same order.
