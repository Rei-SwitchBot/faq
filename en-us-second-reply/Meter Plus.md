### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Meter Plus’s Temperature and Humidity Don’t Appear in Alexa Routines

We apologize for any inconvenience our product caused.
SwitchBot Meter Plus is recognized as a temperature and humidity sensor in the Alexa app. However, Alexa does not yet support using temperature and humidity data as triggers for routines. As a result, you won’t see Meter Plus’s temperature or humidity as available conditions when creating Alexa Routines.
As an alternative, consider using SwitchBot, SmartThings, IFTTT or Apple Home apps. These platforms support setting temperature and humidity data, including readings from the Meter Plus, as triggers for automation. This can help you create more customized routines based on environmental conditions.
If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us.
