### Are There Any Features That Cannot Be Experienced When Using SwitchBot Safety Alarm on My Android Phone?

When using the safety alarm on an Android phone, you cannot access two features:
1. You cannot check the location of the safety alarm when it is outside the Bluetooth range. To use this feature, please add it to Apple's "Find My" app.

2. The anti-malicious tracking feature is not available as it relies on Apple's network and is only accessible on iOS devices.

Other features can be experienced on both Android and iOS devices once the Safety Alarm is added to the SwitchBot app.
