### Can I Use SwitchBot Smart Radiator Thermostat in Scene and Automation Without Buying a Hub?

SwitchBot scenes and automations require a network to operate. The Smart Radiator Thermostat communicates via Bluetooth, so when used in SwitchBot App scenes and automations, you will need to purchase a hub to connect it to the network.
After purchasing a hub, simply place it near the Smart Radiator Thermostat (recommended within 5m), and the thermostat will automatically connect to the hub. You can check the Bluetooth connection status by going to SwitchBot App -> Profile -> Manage hub -> the relevant hub.
