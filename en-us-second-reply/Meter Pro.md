### How Much Data Can Be Stored With SwitchBot Meter Pro?

SwitchBot Meter Pro can store data for up to 68 days. If this time frame is exceeded, the oldest data will be replaced with new data.
When connected to our hub, temperature and humidity data will be saved on a server, enabling a Meter Pro to retain data for a maximum of 2 years.

### How to Change the Temperature Units on SwitchBot Meter Pro's Display to Celsius

If you would like to switch the temperature display on your SwitchBot Meter Pro from Celsius to Fahrenheit (or vice versa), simply press the button on the device itself.
Please note, if you also want to change the temperature unit in the SwitchBot App, you can adjust this by going to SwitchBot App -> Profile -> Preferences -> Temperature Unit.

### Updating Frequency of SwitchBot Meter Pro Data

SwitchBot Meter Pro collects data every 4 seconds and saves it every minute.
After being connected to a Hub series device, the temperature and humidity data is uploaded to the SwitchBot server. The interval displayed in the app and the export file will depend on how much the temperature changes in the environment. For instance, if there are small temperature changes, it will record every 30 minutes. If there are larger changes, it may record every 10 minutes or even every 2 minutes.

### Instructions for the Weather Forecasts Displayed on SwitchBot Meter Pro

SwitchBot Meter Pro can display the local weather forecast in the top left corner of the screen. To enable this feature, please ensure that your account has a connected Hub and that the Meter Pro is within the Hub's Bluetooth range.
Once connected to the Hub, the Meter Pro will show the 24-hour weather overview for the day. The forecast updates every 12 hours starting from the time the device was added to the app, and includes weather conditions such as snow, rainy, overcast, cloudy, clear, light snow, and drizzle.
If you have multiple Meter Pros added to the SwitchBot App at different times, the weather displayed on their screens may vary. In this case, simply press the top button of the device once and wait for 10 seconds to refresh the screen display.

### Batteries for SwitchBot Meter Pro

SwitchBot Meter Pro is powered by two AA alkaline batteries, which typically last for about one year. 
We do not recommend using rechargeable batteries, but if you choose to use them, please ensure that the combined voltage of both batteries does not exceed 3V, as this could potentially damage the device.
SwitchBot Meter Pro can measure from -20°C to 80°C.  However, we recommend using batteries in all SwitchBot products within a temperature range of 5°C to 45°C. Extreme cold or hot environments are not suitable for battery use. In low temperatures, battery efficiency decreases, which can result in insufficient power. High temperatures can cause the battery to react more intensely, leading to rapid discharge or even risks such as leakage or swelling.


---
### Comfort Level Display on SwitchBot Meter Pro

By default, the comfort range is set between 18°C to 28°C for temperature and 30% to 70% for humidity. You can adjust and customize this comfort range in the SwitchBot App according to your preferences.
When displaying local temperature and humidity on the Meter Pro screen, the comfort range will automatically align with the Meter Pro’s configured settings. However, if you set the screen to show data from other SwitchBot meters, the comfort display will adjust according to the data source.
For example:
- If the top section of the screen shows Meter Pro data and the bottom shows local temperature and humidity, both sections will follow the Meter Pro’s comfort settings.
- If the top section shows Meter Pro data and the bottom shows data from an Outdoor Meter, the top will follow the Meter Pro’s settings, while the bottom will reflect the comfort range set for the Outdoor Meter.

If the comfort indicator arrow is not displayed on your Meter Pro screen, please check both the temperature and humidity settings. The comfort level is only achieved when both the set temperature and humidity ranges are reached simultaneously.

You can check the default and adjust comfort range in the following order:
- Launch SwitchBot App and log in.
- Tap your Meter Pro.
- Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- Tap "Comfort Level" on the settings screen.

Note:
Currently, SwitchBot Meter, Hub 2, and Hub Mini Matter Enabled do not support comfort level, so they will not display comfort level when synced to the Meter Pro as a data source.

### Does SwitchBot Meter Pro Have a Magnet Like the Meter Plus Has?

Due to their larger size and heavier weight, the SwitchBot Meter Pro and CO2 Monitor do not include built-in magnets or a magnet plate. Unlike the Meter and Meter Plus, these devices are not designed to be attached to metal surfaces like a refrigerator, and we do not recommend using them in this way.

### How to Set Up Temperature and Humidity Alerts for SwitchBot Outdoor Meter When Displayed on the Screen of the Meter Pro

After displaying the Outdoor Meter on the screen of the Meter Pro, if you wish the alerts from both devices when a certain temperature and humidity level is reached, it is necessary to configure the alert settings on each device individually within their respective settings menus.
Additionally, since the Outdoor Meter does not emit sound or have a screen, if you wish to be alerted via blinking data and sound, you will need to configure these settings separately on the Meter Pro.
Setting 1
- Launch SwitchBot App and log in.
- Tap Meter Pro.
- Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- Tap "Alert Conditions".
- Enable and set the alert range for temperature, humidity, absolute humidity, dew point, and VPD as needed.
- Enable "Alert Sound & Light" if you would like the screen to flash or an alarm to sound when the alert setpoint is reached.

Setting 2
- Launch SwitchBot App and log in.
- Tap Outdoor Meter.
- Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- Tap “Alert conditions” on the Settings screen.
- Enable alerts for temperature, humidity, absolute humidity, dew point temperature, and VPD as desired.
- Set and save the alert range.


If you have a Hub product, you will receive alert notifications on your smartphone when the preset conditions are met. Without a Hub product and using Bluetooth, the temperature and humidity will display in red on the SwitchBot app when alert conditions are reached.
