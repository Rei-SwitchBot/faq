We regret to inform you that the display panel on the Hub 2 was designed without a backlight for decimal points, which means this feature is not available on that model. 
For your reference, this functionality has been implemented in our newer model, the Hub 3. Should you have any interest in exploring an upgrade in the future, Hub 3 would be available as an option.
