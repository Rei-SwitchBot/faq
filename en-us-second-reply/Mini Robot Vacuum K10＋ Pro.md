### Troubleshooting After turning off the base from the power source, the robot leaves the base and starts spinning around itself forever

The auto-empty station and the robot communicate via infrared signals. If the auto-empty station loses power, the signal between the station and the robot is interrupted. This may cause the robot to move away from the station and spin as it searches for the signal.
If you need to shut off the power to the auto-empty station for any reason, we can manually turn off the power of the robot.
