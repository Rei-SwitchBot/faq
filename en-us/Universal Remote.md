### Button Allocation Rules for Infrared Remotes Learned with Others Mode on SwitchBot Universal Remote

Last Updated：

2024 Aug 19

Related Products: SwitchBot Universal Remote

SwitchBot App Version: 8.8 or newer

Firmware Version: 3.1 or newer

Starting from firmware version 2.4, you can now use SwitchBot Universal Remote to control infrared remotes learned using the "others" method with the SwitchBot Hub. This enhancement makes it easier than ever to manage your devices.

The "others" method allows you to learn infrared remotes by manually adding and learning each button. Once learned, these buttons are synchronized to the Universal Remote in the exact order they were added. This method ensures that each function is accurately captured and easily accessible.

Here's how the buttons are allocated to the Universal Remote:

The first button learned will be automatically assigned to the "A" button.

The second button goes to the "B" button.

The third button is allocated to the "C" button.

All subsequent buttons, starting from the fourth, are assigned to the "D" button slot, which can hold up to 15 buttons in total.

It's important to note that the positions of the A, B, and C buttons are fixed and cannot be edited. However, the D button area offers flexibility, allowing you to customize the order of the buttons according to your needs. This setup enables you to organize up to 15 different functions conveniently.

### Experience All the Features of SwitchBot Universal Remote With SwitchBot Hub!

Last Updated: 2024 Jul 23

Related Products: SwitchBot Universal Remote

Important Update: Enhanced Experience with SwitchBot Universal Remote

Background:

SwitchBot Universal Remote was designed to control various infrared (IR) devices. However, we've noticed that its range of supported IR devices is limited. To ensure you have the best possible experience, we have decided to enhance its functionality by integrating it more closely with the SwitchBot Hub.

New Policy: Starting with SwitchBot App V8.7, the option to add infrared remote controls directly to the Universal Remote will no longer be available.

This change aims to streamline your experience and provide a more reliable solution.

We recommend using the Universal Remote with the SwitchBot Hub

, which greatly expands its compatibility and functionality. Once connected to the Hub, you can control your IR remotes, operate SwitchBot devices and scenes, as well as access matter functions using the Universal Remote.

Exclusive Offer:

For customers using the Universal Remote without the Hub

, we have exclusive discounts on the SwitchBot Hub for you. Please contact our customer support team for details.

If you have any questions, please contact us via SwitchBot App > Profile > Help & Feedback >Feedback.

### What Should I Do If I Cannot Control TV Volume Over My Universal Remote?

Last Updated: 2024 Jun 6

Related Products: SwitchBot Universal Remote

If your TV or receiver supports HDMI-CEC, your Set Top Box can be controlled using the TV or receiver remote via the HDMI connection.

Try the following if certain features are not working:

1. Confirm that your TV or receiver supports HDMI-CEC. Check with the manufacturer or refer to the manual.

2. Ensure your Set Top Box is connected to an HDMI port that supports HDMI-CEC. Refer to the TV manual for details.

3. Enable HDMI-CEC in your TV or receiver's menu. Look for terms like "Link" or "Sync," e.g., LG: SimpLink, Philips: EasyLink, Samsung: Anynet+, Sharp: Aquos Link, Sony: BRAVIA Sync.

Normally, volume control uses the IR sensor on the front of your TV or receiver, but some receivers use HDMI-CEC instead. With HDMI-CEC, you don't need a clear path between the remote and the receiver.

For details, please see:
