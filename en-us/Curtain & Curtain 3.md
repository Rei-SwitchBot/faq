### Can I Establish a Google Home Routine Action to Control the Opening and Closing of SwitchBot Curtains?

Last Updated: Oct 25th, 2023

Related Products: SwitchBot Curtain, SwitchBot Curtain 3

1． Setting the opening and closing of SwitchBot Curtains as a routine action in Google Home is not possible

2． Within the Add Routine screen of Google Home, the SwitchBot Curtains are included in the list of actions. However, due to certain limitations within Google's infrastructure,

the option to open and close the SwitchBot Curtains cannot be designated as an action.

As a workaround, we suggest using the Automation feature available on the SwitchBot App.

### Can One SwitchBot Curtain/SwitchBot Curtain 3 Be Arranged to Open From the Middle?

Last Updated：

Related Products: SwitchBot Curtain, SwitchBot Curtain 3

Our curtain devices are discreetly positioned behind the drapes in your home, functioning to open and close them by calculating the distance traversed on the device. Just as a double-sliding curtain requires a pair of drapes, similarly, two units are necessary to facilitate the opening and closing of the curtains. Accomplishing this with a single unit is unfeasible.

### Can SwitchBot Curtain 3 Utilize the Solar Panel From SwitchBot  Curtain 2?

Last Updated：

2023 Aug 21

Related Products: SwitchBot Curtain, SwitchBot Curtain 3

1． The charging port of SwitchBot Curtain 3 is a Type C, identical to that of the original SwitchBot Curtain.

Therefore, there's no issue in using the solar panel from the original SwitchBot Curtain with the SwitchBot Curtain 3

. However, ensure that the solar panel is firmly secured with Velcro. This ensures the panel won't fall due to gravity or have the charging cable disconnected accidentally.

2． The solar panel of SwitchBot Curtain 3 can technically be connected to the SwitchBot Curtain, but when installed, it hangs at right angles to the window glass. This orientation makes it nearly impossible for the panel to receive direct sunlight for charging. Furthermore, the latest version of the solar panel features a connector designed for a secure fit with SwitchBot Curtain 3. However, if the panel is directly connected to the SwitchBot Curtain, the weight of the panel may bear down on the Type C port, potentially causing damage to the charging port. Please avoid using it in this manner.

### Information on the Quietdrift Feature in SwitchBot Curtain 3

Last Updated：

2023 Aug 16

Related Products: SwitchBot Curtain 3

SwitchBot App Version: 7.4 or newer

1． In QuietDrift mode, the device operates so subtly and silently that users won't notice the movement of the curtains. The noise level is less than 25 dB, which is measured at a distance of 1 meter from the device. When SwitchBot Curtain 3 is situated directly adjacent to your ear, you may discern the faint hum of the motor. However, stepping just slightly away diminishes the sound to the point that it becomes almost inaudible. In practical, everyday use, the curtains can be operated, both opened and closed, without causing any audible disturbance.

2． When using QuietDrift mode, the battery tends to drain quickly. Therefore, it is recommended to pair the use of QuietDrift with a solar panel.

3． SwitchBot Curtain 3 can be configured to operate in QuietDrift mode, with features like automation, delay execution, and scheduling provided.

4． Open the SwitchBot application → activate the "QuietDrift Control" → On this screen, you can open and close Curtain 3 using the QuietDrift mode.

Note: To manipulate the opening and closing of Curtain 3 in QuietDrift mode using the SwitchBot App, you are required to access this screen and manually activate the "QuietDrift Control" each time.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25991474877463)

5． The ability to open and close SwitchBot Curtain 3 in QuietDrift mode using the remote button is not yet supported.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Curtain 3 Is Not Aligned Properly on the Rail and Can't Attach the Hook to the Unit

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.

### About Curtain 3's "Efficient charging even on low lighting conditions"

When SwitchBot Curtain 2 is connected to the solar panel, SwitchBot App will display either "Connected, Not Charging" or "Connected, Charging." However, if the light level is insufficient (below level 6), the solar panel will not charge the Curtain 2.

On the other hand, the SwitchBot Curtain 3 solar panel has "low light charging" capabilities, allowing it to charge even without direct sunlight. However, it does not ensure a consistent battery level increase.

For instance, on a cloudy day, it may only charge 5% while the Curtain 3 consumes 10% of the battery by opening and closing throughout the day. As the usage surpasses the charging rate, the SwitchBot app might display that the solar panel is not effectively charging.

As shown in the diagram, when exposed to sunlight that creates distinct shadow outlines, the solar panel can supply enough power for the Curtain 3 to operate. Otherwise, even if connected to the solar panel, it will only maintain the current power level or decrease it gradually.

### Can I Extend the Solar Panel for SwitchBot Curtain 3?

We’re sorry to inform you that the solar panel for Curtain 3 cannot be extended. The connector for the foldable solar panel is custom-designed, and using a standard extension cable may cause it to detach or malfunction. Unfortunately, this means extending the solar panel is not supported at this time.
We understand that the current length of the solar panel may not meet everyone’s needs, and we truly appreciate your feedback. Rest assured, we will take this into account and work on improvements for future products to address this limitation and provide a more flexible solution.
Thank you for your understanding and support as we continue to innovate and enhance your experience with our products.
