### What causes the noise from the SwitchBot Humidifier Adapter?

Your Humidifier's AC adapter contains a circuit that converts AC power to DC power or voltage. When this circuit works, it vibrates, causing the adapter to make a noise.

In normal use, this noise will not be noticed, but in quieter environments, such as late at night, it may be noticeable and unpleasant.

Please be assured that strict quality control has been carried out to ensure that this noise does not interfere with your use of the product.

We are currently working to improve the design and production of our AC adapters to reduce the noise.

We will do our best to provide you with better products and services in the future.

Thank you very much for your cooperation and understanding.

### Why My Humidifier Keeps Working Even Over the Preset Humidity Level

Most traditional humidifiers would stop working when they reach the preset humidity level. But SwitchBot Humidifier will keep working even when it reaches the preset humidity level.

We designed it this way in order to make the environment always stay a comfortable humidity level. The humidifier will automatically adjust the fan while reaching the preset humidity level and keep the whole room ±5% than the preset humidity level.

For example, if you preset the humidity at 55% and the environment humidity is around 1%-50%, the humidifier will turn the fan to the strong mode and humid the environment fast. After the sensor detects the humidity is 55%±5%, the humidifier turns the fan to the middle mode. When the humidity over 60% (55%+5%), the humidifier turns the fan to lowerest mode and keep the humidity near 55%.

Kindly note that the preset of the SwitchBot Humidifier for Auto mode is 55%. If you need to stop the humidifier once it reaches the desired humidity. Please kindly use it with the SwitchBot Hub Plus/Mini and the scene feature.

### Why the Fan in My Humidifier Keeps Working Even When I Turn It Off

Most traditional humidifiers would stop working at once when they are turned off. But SwitchBot Humidifier will keep running the fan for a while even when it was turned off.

This is an anti-microbial design for the SwitchBot Humidifier. After you turn the humidifier off, the fan inside the humidifier will keep running for a few minutes to keep the device dry. With this design, the humidifier will be protected from the bacteria and fungus.
