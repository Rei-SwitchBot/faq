### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Keypad Vision's Face Recognition Failed

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. If you are wearing a beard, it might occasionally affect recognition accuracy. We are enhancing our facial recognition algorithm in the upcoming firmware update (expected in approximately 2 months). Thank you for your understanding!

2. Direct sunlight on the device or your face (including backlight situations) can mess with recognition. Try installing it on the side of your doorframe using the included A+B mounting plates to see if it helps.

3. For optimal facial recognition performance when wearing glasses, sunglasses, helmets or hats, we recommend registering your face twice - once while wearing these items and once without. Similarly, please create separate facial profiles for daytime and nighttime conditions to ensure reliable recognition in different lighting environments. 

4. If your kids are having trouble with face recognition, try having them stand about 90–100 cm (35–39 inches) away from the device when unlocking. Another option is to adjust the mounting height to around 1.2 meters (47 inches), which works well for both adults and kids. If needed, you can also try increasing the recognition sensitivity in the settings for better results.

5. Please update the firmware to V1.5 and set the face recognition sensitivity to high if automatic face recognition activation does not work and manual activation is possible for authentication.

### What Charging Adapter Should I Use to Charge SwitchBot Keypad Vision?

Please use a 5V2A charging adapter for the Keypad Vision. 
It takes about 6 hours to fully charge the Keypad Vision. While charging, the indicator will light up in red and change to green when charging is complete. If an adapter below specifications (for example, 5V1A) is used, the indicator on the device will flash alternately between red and green to indicate a charging abnormality.

### Troubleshooting Facial Recognition of Keypad Vision Doesn't Work During Charging.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
When Keypad Vision is connected to power, both face registration and recognition features are temporarily unavailable. This is a proactive safety precaution we've implemented to prevent extremely rare cases where simultaneous charging and facial recognition processing could potentially create electrical conflicts.
Rest assured, this limitation is purely temporary. Full functionality will automatically restore as soon as charging completes, you'll know it's ready when the indicator light turns green. We recommend using your passcode, fingerprint, or NFC card for uninterrupted access while charging.
We want to emphasize that this design choice was made with your long-term product safety and reliability in mind. We understand that this may sometimes be inconvenient, but we appreciate your patience and understanding. Please rest assured that we will take your feedback into consideration for future product improvements.
If you have any other questions or need assistance, our support team is always here to help.

### Troubleshooting the Lock Was Unlocked Again After Being Scanned by SwitchBot Keypad Vision When I Locked It with a Key.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. If you lock the door without using the Keypad Vision, the Lock status will not sync automatically with it. This means that setting a sleep period on the Keypad Vision won't work, and the Lock will unlock when your face is scanned.
2. To enable communication between the Keypad Vision and the lock product, go to the SwitchBot App -> Keypad Vision -> Gear Icon -> Turn on Quick Unlocking. This setting ensures that after manually locking the door, the status will be synced to the Keypad Vision via Bluetooth. Your Lock will not unlock during sleep mode, even if your face is scanned.
3. If the problem persists, consider setting activation times for your Keypad Vision by navigating to SwitchBot App -> Keypad Vision -> Gear Icon -> Face Entry Settings -> Trigger Face Recognition -> Custom. Once you set a custom activation time, the Keypad Vision will automatically activate when your face is scanned during that time. Outside this specified time, you will need to manually activate the device.
