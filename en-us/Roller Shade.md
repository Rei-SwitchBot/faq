### Can I Use SwitchBot Curtain Solar Panel for My Roller Shade?

### What Is the Recommended Length for Customizing SwitchBot Roller Shade Fabric?

Related Product: SwitchBot Roller Shade
SwitchBot Roller Shade supports DIY fabric customization. If you prefer to use your own fabric, we recommend adding an extra 10 cm (4 inches) to the height of your window when purchasing fabric. For example, if your window height is 150 cm (59 inches), consider buying fabric that is 160 cm (63 inches) long.

Having extra fabric allows for proper rolling and ensures full coverage. If the fabric is too short, it may affect privacy and light-blocking performance. This simple adjustment will help you achieve the best results when customizing your Roller Shade.

Note: When choosing your shade fabric, remember:

1. Fabric Roll Diameter: The diameter of the rolled-up fabric, including the rod, should not exceed 66mm.

2. Fabric Weight: Keep the fabric weight under 3kg to avoid putting too much strain on the Roller Shade and affecting its performance.

### Instructions for SwitchBot Roller Shade Group Feature

Related Product: SwitchBot Roller Shde
SwitchBot Roller Shades can be grouped for easier control, supporting up to 8 devices in one group.

When you create a group, the first device you select becomes the main device, while the others are designated as secondary devices. Once grouped, all devices will respond together, opening or closing simultaneously and adjusting to the same percentage level. 

If you ever need to control a specific device within the group, simply go to the group control page in the SwitchBot App, tap the main device name, and expand the list to select and adjust the individual device as needed. 

After grouping, the SwitchBot App will automatically merge the secondary devices under the main device, leaving only the main device’s icon visible on the app’s interface. Please note that some settings on sub devices, such as schedules and delay timers, will be reset during the grouping process. Additionally, the entire group can be integrated with cloud, SwitchBot Remote, or Automation/Scene, enabling a seamless and fully connected smart home experience.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Roller Shade Fabric Tilts to One Side While Rolling up

We’re sorry to hear that your Roller Shade fabric is tilting to one side when in use. This issue can often be corrected with a simple adjustment. Please follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve the problem.

1. Make sure that the edge of the PP band aligns with the top tube. If it is misaligned, adjust it to sit evenly along the tube. Watch the video at 7:08 for guidance on how to make this adjustment.

2. If the PP band is aligned correctly but the fabric still shifts to one side, place tape or a thin sponge-like material on the top tube where the fabric is moving (the direction it goes when rolling). Open and close the shade a few times, adjusting the thickness of the tape or spacer as necessary for balance.

3. If the fabric continues to tilt despite these adjustments, please provide us with a video showing the shade tilting while rolling up. Our R&D team will review it and assist you further.

If you need additional support, feel free to reach out.

### Can the Solar Panel from SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Camera Be Used for SwitchBot Roller Shade?

Yes. You can freely combine S, M, L, and XL Roller Shades to fit the width of your window. However, when connecting two or more Roller Shades, please be aware that light gaps may appear at the seams. This is due to slight length discrepancies between the roller mechanism and fabric at the upper connection points of multiple units.
