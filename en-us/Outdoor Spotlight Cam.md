### About the Battery Saving Mode of SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K

Last Updated: 2024 Aug 28

Related Product: SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K

When used as a stand-alone device, the Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K can last up to 180 days on a full charge. However, when paired with a SwitchBot Hub and set to “Record Events Only,” the camera will automatically connect to the hub via Bluetooth, effectively doubling the battery life.

Note:

1. Go to SwitchBot App -> Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K -> Gear Icon -> Basic Settings -> Enbale battery saving mode.

2. If the camera is set to “Pre-Event” recording or continuous recording, battery saving mode will not be active, even when using the hub. Which means battery saving mode is only automatically functioned when the camera is set to “Event Only ” and is connected to a hub.

3. In battery saving mode, the camera and hub communicate via Bluetooth, so please ensure that the distance between the two devices remains within Bluetooth range.

4. The battery life estimates provided are based on testing with an average of 10 events per day in front of the camera. More frequent events will result in faster battery consumption.

### How long does Outdoor Spotlight Cam battery last?

Last updated: 2023.03.10

Applicable products:

SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Cam

SwitchBot App version:

6.24 or newer

Device firmware version:

V2.1.15 or newer

Outdoor Spotlight Battery life will last for months with normal use, but remember this is dependent on several factors.

For a longer battery, pay attention to the following points:

1. Make sure your SwitchBot app version is up to date.

2. Make sure the SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Cam is added to the SwitchBot App and the firmware version is up to date.

3. Make sure the camera is not set up in an extremely hot or cold position, as a highly dynamic temperature range can affect battery performance.

4. Avoid placing the camera under direct sunlight.

5. Try to improve the Wi-Fi signal between the camera devices and your Wi-Fi router, as weak/slow internet connectivity may cause the battery to drain faster.

6. Avoid placing the camera near any heat sources or regularly moving objects. Heat sources such as chimneys, outdoor units of a running air-conditioner, or regularly moving objects like wind chimes might trigger notifications constantly.

7. We do not recommend turning on the Motion Detection function when the camera is placed in a high-traffic area. Or we recommend only enabling the Motion Detection function in a remote region or where there there is a little human/animal traffic.

The above measures will extend battery life as notifications are reduced.

To monitor your battery in SwitchBot app:

You can monitor the remaining power of your Outdoor Spotlight Cam in real-time in an upcoming update to the SwitchBot app, which is expected to be released within November 2022.

### The Difference Between Battery Mode and Wired Mode of the Outdoor Spotlight Camera

Last Updated: 2024 Sep12

Related Product: SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Camera

Firmware Version: 2.1.25-12

Battery Mode: In most of the time, the Outdoor Spotlight Camera sleeps and shuts down in battery mode. It will awake only when it detects a person or animal, and starts to detect motion and records. (A creature with sensitive temperatures, such as a person or animal, is required for the camera to be awoken.)

Wired Mode: The Outdoor Spotlight Camera does not sleep or shut down. It is always running and motion detection will be triggered whenever a person or animal is captured.

The outdoor camera under Wired Mode is equivalent to the function of a SwitchBot Indoor Cam and the battery will drain fast. Therefore, we recommend using the Wired Mode mode while charging.

Note:

Outdoor Spotlight Camera 2K does not have a battery mode or wired mode.

### What to Do If I Can't Charge My Outdoor Spotlight Cam with the Solar Panel?

Last Updated: 2024 Jun 14

Related Products: SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Cam

SwitchBot App Version: 8.5 or newer

Firmware Version: 2.1.15-1.2

1. Make sure your SwitchBot App version is up to date.

2. Make sure SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Cam has been added to your App and your device firmware version is up to date.

3. Make sure proper connection and charging of the solar panel for the Outdoor Spotlight Cam. When viewing the Outdoor Spotlight Cam on the SwitchBot App, check for the presence of a sun icon within the battery icon to indicate that the solar panel is successfully charging.

4. If you want to charge the battery with a solar panel, please set the power mode of the Outdoor Spotlight Cam to battery mode.

SwitchBot App -> Outdoor Spotlight Cam -> Gear Icon -> Basic Settings -> Power Mode -> Set to Battery Mode.

5. The solar panel can charge the battery by approximately 4% per hour. The more activity in front of the Outdoor Spotlight Cam, the quicker the battery drains. In some cases, the depletion may exceed the charging amount, causing the battery to run down even after recharging. If necessary, we recommend using a charging adapter to recharge the battery.

6. If your Outdoor Spotlight Cam's battery is draining unusually fast without any activity, please provide the following information would be useful:

- Keep the panel surface clean and undamaged – remove leaves/debris immediately
- Maintain installation angle below 45 degrees from horizontal for optimal performance

3. If the battery drains quickly, you may not be able to reach 100% even with continuous charging. Any of the following settings may drain the battery at a high rate, so adjust settings as needed to prevent high battery drain.
- Make sure that the recording mode is not set to "Continuous" or "Pre-event" as these modes will deplete the battery more quickly. To check, go to SwitchBot App -> Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K -> Gear icon -> Local Storage -> Recording.

- Check the motion sensitivity setting by going to SwitchBot App -> Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K -> Gear icon -> Motion Detection -> Sensitivity. If the detection sensitivity is set to high, the battery will drain faster.
- Check the detection mode setting by going to SwitchBot App -> Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K -> Gear icon -> Motion Detection -> Detection Mode. If the detection mode is set to "more protection", the battery will be drained faster.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K Suddenly Drains All Batteries

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Make sure you are using the power adapter when using continuous recording or pre-event recording modes. The battery may drain completely within a day, even if a solar panel is connected under these two recording modes. You can check the recording mode by going to -> SwitchBot App -> Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K -> Gear Icon -> Local Storage.
2. Open the cover on the back of the camera, then you will see an on/off button, switch it off, wait two minutes, then turn it back on.

If the battery only lasts about two weeks, take these precautions:
In winter, colder temperatures can reduce the battery level. At -20°C, the battery may decrease by 40% to 50%.
The battery drains faster when many events occur in front of the camera lens. Adjust detection settings like time zone, area, sensitivity, or limit detection to people to improve this.
