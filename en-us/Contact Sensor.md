![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998492835223)

※ Precautions for using the 3M adhesive tapes.

(1) Clean the area where the tape is to be applied, and if it is wet, dry it before applying.

(2）After applying the tape, press down hard for about 60 seconds to make sure it does not peel off. The adhesive strength of the double-sided tape may not be strong at first, but it will become strong enough after about one day and night.

### SwitchBot Contact Sensor "Motion Detected" and "No Motion Detected"

This article explains the logic behind the recognition of "motion detected" and "no motion detected".

(1)"Motion detected."

When a user enters a detection area that has detected "no motion detected", the SwitchBot Contact Sensor will immediately recognize "motion detected". Any scene or automation that uses "motion detected" as a trigger condition will be triggered and executed immediately.

(2)"No Motion detected."

To prevent malfunction, false alarms, and false detections, the Contact Sensor does not immediately recognize "no motion detected" when the user leaves the detection area.

When no motion is detected for 30 seconds, the Contact Sensor will determine and recognize "no motion detected". Any scene or automation that uses "no motion detected" as a trigger condition will be triggered and executed.

For example:

1, Contact Sensor: "No motion detected" at 13:00:00

User: Enters the detection area which was recognized as "no motion detected" at 13:01:00

2, Contact Sensor: Recognizes "motion detected" at 13:01:00

User: Leaves the detection area at 13:05:00

3, Contact Sensor: Recognizes "no motion detected" at 13:05:30



---
### The Contact Sensor detection status shown in the SwitchBot app is different from the actual status of the device.

If the device detection status indicated by the app is different from the actual status of the device, please check the device history.

1, If the history contains a history of the actual state of the device

① The device detection function operates normally. The network connection may be unstable and there may be a delay in updating the status of the application. Please check your network environment.

② Otherwise, this issue might be caused by the insufficient installation of the magnet.

Please refer to the below picture to install the Contact sensor correctly.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25999675656599)

2, If there is no history of the actual state of the device in the history

If the device was successfully added, but there is no history of state changes or execution in the device history, it may be defective.

Please contact our support team through "Feedback" in your app profile. Feedback includes the ability to record your phone screen. Please use it to help us identify the problem quickly. Thank you for your patience.

Google home cannot trigger Routines via Sensors, like motion sensors & door/windows sensors, which has been promising for almost 2 years, Routines can only be triggered Via Voice or Time of day. If you already have some other hubs, you can connect Sensors to them but they will not show up inside Google Home.

We need to Trigger Google Routines using an Amazon Echo. Here is a video made by Home that has explained more details:
