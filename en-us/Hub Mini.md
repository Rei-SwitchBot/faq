### Does SwitchBot Bot connect to multiple Hubs?

No. SwitchBot Bot automatically selects the nearest SwitchBot Hub Mini the first time you enable the Third-party Service for it in Bot Settings. It always uses the paired Hub Mini then.

If you have multiple Hubs, and your SwitchBot Bot is always not reachable via the Internet or via a third party ( Such as Alexa, Google Home, Siri), try to disable the Third-party Service for the SwitchBot Bot and enable it again.

### How to Add Air Conditioner by "Customize" Mode？

To add your AC, please try "Smart Learning" or "Manual Selection" first.

If "Smart Learning" and "Manual Selection" doesn't work, let's try "Customize" your AC remote. ↓↓

Every infrared command of an air conditioner remote

includes

on/off status, temperature, mode (Heat/Cool/Dehumidify/Auto) of the target device. So you cannot do button learning individually like learning TV, light etc.

To customize an air conditioner remote, you need to set the final status, temperature, mode in the App panel first, then press the button on your original remote to send the command.

For example, to learn the 'ON' command setting to cool mode at 20°C.

1) On your original remote, set the mode to cool and the temperature to 21°C. (If its temperature step is 0.5°C, you may set to '20.5°C'.)

![Image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc249a_d4e3fb1740f644579a58457cae39b10d~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_450,h_183,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cc249a_d4e3fb1740f644579a58457cae39b10d~mv2.webp)

2) On the app panel, tap ‘ON’ to start learning then set to ‘Cool’ mode and 20°C in the pop-up window.

![Image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc249a_4d12fa3a077d463587d7d8cc5091e02d~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_450,h_627,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cc249a_4d12fa3a077d463587d7d8cc5091e02d~mv2.webp)

4) The learning is done If the ‘ON’ button in the app panel turns blue.

![Image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc249a_cca268cd20334fdfbbaeef0d2483fbac~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_450,h_198,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cc249a_cca268cd20334fdfbbaeef0d2483fbac~mv2.webp)

Congratulations, every time you press this 'ON' button it will set your air conditioner to cool mode at 20°C.

To learn the 'OFF' command, just tap the 'OFF' button on the App panel then press 'OFF' button on your original remote to learn. If there is a power button named ‘ON/OFF’ on the remote, please press the power button during the air conditioner running (so it will turn off your target device) to learn the ‘OFF’ button in the App panel.

Please note the Alexa/Google Home integration of a customized air conditioner supports 'ON' and 'OFF' commands only currently.

To add more functions, please let us know the brand and model number of your air conditioner by sending an email to

[support@switch-bot.com](mailto:support@switch-bot.com)

### How to Add Infrared Appliances to SwitchBot Hub Mini?

Last Updated: 2023 May 26

Related Products: SwitchBot Hub Mini

SwitchBot App Version: 7.0 or newer

Firmware Version: 3.9-2.6 or newer

Before registering the home appliance remote control, first, add the SwitchBot Hub Mini to the SwitchBot app.

[Embedded Content](//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2tTwpKXfOec)

* Please refer to the following because the customization mode of the air conditioner is different from the customization mode of ordinary home appliances.

[How to register the air conditioner remote control in "Customize"](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038373593-How-to-add-Air-Conditioner-by-Customize-mode-)

The learning method may differ depending on the model number of the infrared remote control, so let's use the following four learning modes and add home appliance remote controls one by one!

Well, let me guide you through the four modes of "Smart Matching(Smart Learning)", "Select Manually(Find Manufacturer)", "Learn Buttons(Customize)" and "Other".

When learning, if an error such as "learning failure 4" or "timed out" appears on the screen, there is a possibility that the corresponding button will function wirelessly instead of infrared.

When registering the remote control, bring the remote control closer to the hub mini and adjust the angle and distance from the hub mini. If the button is recognized, you will see an indication of success.

Smart Matching(Smart Learning)

Open the SwitchBot app and tap the Hub Mini icon.

Tap

Add Appliance

and choose the appliance type that you want to add.

Point the physical remote to your Hub Mini and tap "Smart Learning". Then follow the app's guide to help learn your remote's functionality.

Select Manually(Find Manufacturer)

If Smart Learning doesn't work, you can try selecting the brand and model manually.

Tap

Manual Selection

at the bottom of the learning mode page.

Choose your appliance brand and then select the corresponding model.

(Please note: if you can not find an exact number, we recommend trying a similar model as many share the same features.)

Test your remote, and save.

Manual mode still can't learn your remote? No worries, you can try

Customize

mode instead.

Learn Buttons(Customize)

Tap customize at the bottom of the

Brand

page.

Point your appliance remote at SwitchBot Hub Mini and follow the app's guide to mimic your remote's buttons.

Buttons should change to blue on your app once learning is successful.

Others

You can use this mode to program your buttons one by one and name it by feature or use an alias of your choice.

Roll down the page and choose the

Others

category.

Point your appliance remote at SwitchBot Hub Mini and follow the app's guide to mimic your remote's buttons.

Tap the "+" icon and name your button.

Tap

Start

after you name your button, and then press the remote button once when the indicator on your SwitchBot Hub Mini is off.

After receiving a message that learning is completed, tap

Test

to test your button.

If your button works, tap

Save

and continue to add other buttons.

After you have set up all buttons, tap

Save

to save this remote.

Note:

Your button alias can not be changed once set. If you need to change it, you need to delete it and set it again.

Please note: buttons set using this mode cannot be controlled directly by Alexa or Google Assistant.

Alternatively, you could create a Manual Scene via our app to control via Alexa, Google Assistant, or IFTTT. For details regarding this, please check here (Alexa) or here (Google Assistant).

![Image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/826c4e_04c022e8b6c44234a12a27a837d50621~mv2_d_2290_1354_s_2.png/v1/fill/w_925,h_547,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/826c4e_04c022e8b6c44234a12a27a837d50621~mv2_d_2290_1354_s_2.png)

This section provides information on router settings. As the configuration method differs depending on the router model, please contact the manufacturer or provider for more information.

1. Make sure your home network does not have security features such as MAC address filtering enabled.

2. Please do the setting work near the WiFi router.

3. 5G Wi-Fi is not supported, so please use 2.4G Wi-Fi. There are two routers, 5G and 2.4G Wi-Fi, but be sure to connect to 2.4G Wi-Fi.

4. Check the security settings of your Wi-Fi router.

Wi-Fi settings (encryption method, DHCP, firewall, etc.) may be the cause.

WPA2-PEAP, WPA3-PEAP, WEP and WPS cannot be supported.

WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK is recommended.

Please make sure that your Wi-Fi router assigns an IP address to the Hub Mini - this is not a problem if you have automatic IP address acquisition (DHCP settings).

If a firewall is configured, Hub Mini may not be able to connect to the ground service. If you cannot connect, please check your firewall settings.

5. In some cases, the issue was resolved by updating the firmware of some routers to the latest version. Please make sure you have the latest version.

6. If you install a Wi-Fi repeater in your home, please make sure that the repeater mainly uses the 2.4Ghz band.

7. Mesh Wi-Fi (a type in which the router automatically switches between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz) is basically automatically connected to 2.4Ghz, so you can use it, but some WiFi routers try to connect to 5Ghz. There are cases where it may be affected, so it is rarely affected.

* The protocol and port information will be "MQTT OVER TCP PORT 8883".

If you are still unable to complete the initial setup after trying the above settings, please try Hub Mini from another network or from your mobile's personal hotspot for troubleshooting.

Please refer to the following method for personal hotspot.

How to set up personal hotspot in phone settings?

1. Select Settings > Cellular or Cellular Data or Settings > Internet Sharing.

2. Tap the slider next to Allow Others to Connect.

3. Enable Internet Sharing, then set up Hub Mini and configure Wi-Fi connection settings.

### Learn More About SwitchBot Hub

Last Updated: 2024 Aug 21

Using a SwitchBot Hub as a bridge

Currently, all SwitchBot products can be divided into two main categories:

Wi-Fi-integrated, these devices have a built-in Wi-Fi module, such as SwitchBot Hub 2 (Wi-Fi+BLE), SwitchBot Pan/Tilt Cam (Wi-Fi), SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 (Wi-Fi+BLE), SwitchBot Plug Mini (Wi-Fi+BLE).

Bluetooth-only or BLE-only (short for Bluetooth Low Energy), these devices are not connected to the internet directly, but they can be controlled directly using Bluetooth-enabled devices such as your smartphone or a SwitchBot Universal Remote (BLE-only). Bluetooth-only devices consume less power than Wi-Fi-integrated devices, but their communication range is shorter.

However, we can still connect SwitchBot Bluetooth-only devices to the internet via a SwitchBot Hub. If we have a hub under the same account and it is within communication range of the Bluetooth-only devices, we can have access to these devices through the internet.

Depending on your app version, things might look different on how you would configure your devices.

App V9.0

In this upcoming major update, it is more intuitive to enable remote access for your SwitchBot Bluetooth-only devices. You would need Beta access for this version at the moment.

Simply add a SwitchBot Hub to your account, such as Hub 2 or Hub Mini. Make sure the Bluetooth-only devices you own is nearby, preferably in the same room and not blocked out by a wall or a door.

If you are not sure the communication is good or not, you can navigate to Profile > Manage Hubs to check the coverage of each hub and tweak the placement of your hub from there.

Once your hub is all set and connected to the internet, any SwitchBot Bluetooth-only devices nearby would have access to the internet instantly.

You can control the Bluetooth-only devices with voice assistants or build some automations with IFTTT or Home Assistant. In the app, navigate to Profile > Third-party Services and connect to one or more of these services. Each of these third-party services or app usually discovers the Bluetooth-only devices automatically and syncs them to their own apps and platforms.

App V8.8 and previous versions

When using Bluetooth-only devices with a hub, you can navigate to the Settings page of your device and turn on Third-party Services to enable more device features.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998138308503)

After turning on Third-party Services, you'll be able to remotely control your device even when outside Bluetooth range. You can also control your devices using third-party smart assistants like Alexa, Google Home, Siri, and more.

When we turn on Third-party Services for SwitchBot Bluetooth devices, they will communicate with your SwitchBot Hub via Bluetooth. The Hub is also communicating with the Cloud via a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. Every time we try to control a SwitchBot Bluetooth device using our smartphone when not in Bluetooth range, the command will go to the Cloud first, and then be forwarded to your SwitchBot Hub. The Hub will tell the corresponding device what to do via Bluetooth signal when it receives the command. You can find out more by checking the image below:

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998107946391)

Controlling infrared appliances via a SwitchBot Hub

SwitchBot Hub Mini and SwitchBot Hub 2 can do more than build a network bridge for SwitchBot Bluetooth devices. There is also an Infrared receiver and emitter built inside that allows them to learn many Infrared remote control commands to enable you to use your remotes virtually via your smartphone.

Your Hub can learn the Infrared signal, and every time you try to control the corresponding infrared appliance over using your smartphone, the command will go to the Cloud first, then it will be forwarded to your SwitchBot Hub. Your Hub will then emit an infrared signal to control the corresponding appliance. You can find out more below:

### What is the difference between Infrared (IR), Bluetooth (BT), Radio Frequency (RF) remote controls of my appliances?

Since our Hub Mini, Ceiling Light remote control devices via Infrared (IR), it is NOT possible to use them for RF or Bluetooth-controlled remotes and appliances. The common formats of remote control signals are described below.

Infrared (Infrared)

Infrared is the only technology used in all of SwitchBot Hub Mini (and other Hub devices), Ceiling Light series, which use pulses of infrared light to send controller data to the appliance. Infrared is invisible to the human eye. Infrared signals do not penetrate walls, so communication is limited by distance and building materials.

To check your Hub Mini compatiblity, refer to:

[How do I know if my appliance remote is IR supported, and can be added to Hub Mini?](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/8072054481047)

Radio Frequency

Radio frequency (RF) is a data transmission technology which is based on electromagnetic radio waves. The advantage of RF is that this technology has a wider signal range. RF can go through and there is no need to point your remote to the device, as it does not require to be in line-of-sight.

Bluetooth

Bluetooth (which is a type of RF) is a wireless communication technology that uses radio waves of a specific frequency to transmit data from one device to another over short distances of up to 10 m. It is used in a variety of products, including

Amazon's Fire TV Stick

,

Roku TV Stick,

XGIMI, and many other electronics and digital devices controllers that use Bluetooth.

Since our Hub Mini control SwitchBot devices via Infrared (IR), it is not possible to use them for most of RF or Bluetooth controlled TV's or appliances.

### Troubleshooting My SwitchBot Hub mini can't learn IR remotes

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Make sure that the home appliance you are using is infrared remote control. If the remote control is a mixture of infrared and Bluetooth, only the infrared button can be used.
2. Please use the latest version of the SwitchBot app from the app store. Issues may occur when using the Beta version. Thank you for your understanding.  
3. Make sure your Hub Mini firmware version is 5.1-6.2 or later if it can connect to your smartphone's hotspot. If not, update it near the device by following this sequence: SwitchBot App → Hub Mini → Gear Icon → Firmware & Battery.
3. Make sure that the hub mini is powered by a 5V1A/5V2A adapter.
4. Make sure that you are connected to a stable 2.4GHz network. If the network is disconnected, the lamp on the hub mini will blink.
5. Make sure that there are no walls or other obstacles between the Hub Mini and the appliance, as infrared signals do not pass through walls.
6. Since the Hub Mini operates the appliance instead of the remote control attached to the appliance, place the Hub Mini within the infrared reception range of the appliance.
7. Please adjust the installation position of the Hub Mini until the appliance actually responds.

### Troubleshooting When I Turn on the AC with SwitchBot App, the AC Units Displays Celsius Instead of Fahrenheit, and I Have a Hub Mini.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, after reviewing the situation with our R&D team, we'd like to explain what's happening:
When using the SwitchBot app to control your air conditioner, the infrared signals sent by the Hub are based on the Celsius temperature scale. This means your AC unit receives the command in Celsius, causing it to display temperatures in Celsius. Although the SwitchBot app allows you to see and set the temperature in Fahrenheit for your convenience, this conversion happens only within the app, the actual signal that's sent to your AC remains in Celsius.
By comparison, your physical remote sends signals in Fahrenheit, which is why the AC continues to display Fahrenheit when used directly.
We sincerely apologize that our current Hub devices do not support sending infrared commands in Fahrenheit. Our team is continuously working to improve our products and services, and we've shared your feedback with our R&D team for future consideration.
We understand this isn't the ideal experience you expected, and we're truly sorry for the frustration it may have caused. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to let us know. We're here to help.
Thank you for your understanding and support!

### Troubleshooting Requires the Mac Address to Add SwitchBot Hub Mini, Which Cannot Be Found.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The MAC address of the Hub Mini is not listed on the device itself or its packaging.  
If your home router has a whitelist set up, connect the Hub Mini to your smartphone's tethering first and add it to the SwitchBot app. Then, follow these steps in the app to find the Wi-Fi MAC address: Hub Mini → gear icon → Device Info.
If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

### Troubleshooting Only the Power and Mute Buttons on the TV Remote Can Be Learned with SwitchBot Hub Mini, Other Buttons Cannot.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
Our hub is only compatible with infrared remote controls. Hybrid infrared/bluetooth remotes can only learn buttons that have an infrared signal. If you are using the "learn buttons" method and can only program the power or mute buttons on your TV remote, it's likely that these are the only buttons with an infrared signal, indicating that the remote is not fully infrared-compatible.
To confirm whether your remote uses infrared, please send us a photo of the unit, and we’ll assess it for you. For detailed specifications, we also recommend checking with the manufacturer directly.
Important Note:
If the remote control of household appliances has "NETFLIX", "Prime Video", Google Assistant, and Alexa voice button, then it is likely to be a remote control that supports Bluetooth or wireless overall. Our hub cannot be used to adding these remotes.

*If you have already provided this information, our team will review it and follow up with you shortly. Thank you for your patience, and please let us know if you need further assistance.

### How to Add Air Conditioner Remotes by "Learn Buttons" Mode Using SwitchBot Hub Mini

If the IR remotes cannot be added using "Smart Matching" or "Select Manually," or if the appliance does not respond, please try the "Learn Buttons" method.
- Launch SwitchBot App and log in.
- Tap your Hub.
- Tap the "+" icon to add remote control.
- Select "Air Conditioner" under Home Appliances.
- Tap "Learn Buttons".

Important Note:
- Air conditioner remotes send combined information for operation mode (heating/cooling/dehumidifying/auto) and temperature. The hub functions as a substitute for the remote, operating in the same manner. This means it is not possible to learn just the operation mode or temperature separately.
- When using the "Learn Buttons" method, you can only configure two buttons: "ON" and "OFF." Assign the power-off function to the OFF button, and program your frequently used operation mode and temperature (e.g., in summer: cooling + 25°C + automatic air volume) to the ON button.
- You can program multiple air conditioner remotes based on your preferences (e.g., for winter: heating + 29°C + automatic fan speed).
- Remote controls added using the "Learn Buttons" method are compatible with Third-party services such as Alexa, Google Home, and IFTTT.

### How to Add Air Conditioner Remotes by "Others" Mode Using SwitchBot Hub Mini

If the IR remotes cannot be added using "Smart Matching" or "Select Manually," or if the appliance does not respond, please try the "Others" method.
- Launch SwitchBot App and log in.
- Tap your Hub.
- Tap the "+" icon to add remote control.
- Scroll down and then tap "Others".

Important Note:
- Air conditioner remotes send combined information for operation mode (heating/cooling/dehumidifying/auto) and temperature. The hub functions as a substitute for the remote, operating in the same manner. This means it is not possible to learn just the operation mode or temperature separately.
- In the "Others" mode, buttons must be added manually one by one.
- Remote controls added through the "Others" mode are not compatible with third-party services like Alexa or Google Home. For voice control, we recommand using SwitchBot Scenes instead.
[https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/19444800636183](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/19444800636183-How-to-Create-Scene)
- For "Others" modes and custom-added buttons, it is not possible to set the button name as a number from 1 to 100. Example: Button name: 1 (x), Button name: N1 (√)

### How to Transfer Learned Infrared Remotes From One Hub Mini to Another

1. Make sure your SwitchBot App version is up to date.
2. Make sure your Hub products have been added to your App and your device firmware version is up to date.

- Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- Tap "Hub" on the settings screen.
- Select and save another hub product in your account.
By using this setting, the chosen infrared remote control will connect to the selected hub.

Method 2
Use the "Duplicate remotes" function.
SwitchBot App -> Tap the migration destination hub -> Tap the add the remote icon "+" -> Tap "Duplicate from another hub" -> Select the target IR remotes to copy.
