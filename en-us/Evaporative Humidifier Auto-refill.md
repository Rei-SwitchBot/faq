### Can the Auto-Refill Function of SwitchBot Evaporative Humidifier (Auto-Refill) Be Used When Cleaning the Floor With a Cleaning Solution Using S10?

Last Updated: 2024 Aug 21

Related Products: SwitchBot Evaporative Humidifier (Auto-Refill), SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10

Once SwitchBot Evaporative Humidifier (Auto-refill) is connected to the S10, you can use the S10 to automatically supply water to the humidifier.

Since the S10 main unit and the water station use the same water supply tube, do not use the Evaporative Humidifier's auto-refill function when the water station is filled with cleaning solution.

A small amount of cleaning solution may stick to the water supply tube, and during humidifier operation, this cleaning solution could mix in and be released into the air.

If you have already added cleaning solution to the S10 water station, please disable the auto-add solution feature in the SwitchBot App. Then, vacuum and mop your floor once. You can use the auto-refill function safely after using all of the cleaning solutions mixed with clean water.

Way to disable the auto-add solution:

SwitchBot App -> Floor Cleaning Robot S10 -> Gear icon -> Maintenance -> disable the Auto-add Solution

### Can I Use Essential Oils in SwitchBot Evaporative Humidifier Auto-refill?

Related Product: SwitchBot Evaporative Humidifier Auto-refill
The Evaporative Humidifier works by using a fan to blow air through a moist filter, releasing water vapor to humidify the air.

Currently, the Evaporative Humidifier does not have a dedicated compartment for essential oils. Adding essential oils directly to the water tank is not recommended, as the oils can be blown onto the filter by the fan. This may reduce the filter's lifespan and compromise the effectiveness of the essential oils.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Evaporative Humidifier Won’t Start and the App Shows "Filter Not Installed" Even Though the Filter Is Installed

We’re sorry to hear that your Evaporative Humidifier isn’t detecting the installed filter, preventing it from starting. This issue is likely related to the magnetic sensor in the filter frame. Please follow the steps below to diagnose the problem.
Check the Magnetic Sensor in the Filter Frame:
The filter frame has a built-in magnet that helps the humidifier detect whether the filter is installed. To check if the magnet is functioning:
- Remove the filter frame from the humidifier.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b96ec4b-6931-43c1-83f3-5c8324dddc73)

- Use a metal object, such as a small iron rod or any magnetic material, to touch the marked area on the frame (see image below).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29f7dc2b-bea6-4675-8203-1759a0a12d82)

If the magnet is not responsive, the sensor may not be properly installed in the filter frame. Our support team will arrange a new one for you.
If the magnet is present and responsive, there may be an issue with the humidifier itself.  In this case, a device replacement may be needed. To expedite the process, please provide the following details:
- Purchase channel
- Order ID
- Recipient Full Name
- Phone Number
- Country
- Street Address
- City
- State/Province
- ZIP/Postal Code

### Troubleshooting My Evaporative Humidifier Filter is Yellowing, Moldy, or Has an Odor

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Make sure the filter is completely dried after every use. Failure to dry the filter increases the risk of discoloration, odors, and the growth of mold or bacteria.
