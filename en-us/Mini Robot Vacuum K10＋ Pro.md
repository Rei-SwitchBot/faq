5GHz Wi-Fi has a higher transmission speed than 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, but it is vulnerable to obstacles such as walls, and the signal weakens as the transmission distance increases. Seeking to work more stably, we have decided to support only 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, which is not as fast but is more stable.

### Troubleshooting Guide for Constant Orange Light on Dual Dust Collection Station

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Make sure the dust bag is correctly installed. Open the lid of the dual empty station, remove and reinsert the dust bag, and adjust its position if necessary. Proper installation will cause the orange light to blink three times as confirmation ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8uw7jBzZwsT0Hl8swe2kYFxZOP-iUMz/view)).
2. Make sure the lid of the dual empty station is properly positioned. Avoid reversing the front and back sides, as this can interfere with detection.

Note: Since the dust bag is not installed, the orange light will remain constantly on afterward.

### Troubleshooting After turning off the base from the power source, the robot leaves the base and starts spinning around itself forever

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding the issue, could you please check the following points?

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Mini Robot Vacuum K10+ Pro Not Picking up the Trash on the Floor When Performing Cleaning Tasks

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Mini Robot Vacuum K10+ Pro Won’t Enter Dark Carpet Areas

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The K10+ Pro is equipped with highly sensitive cliff sensors designed to ensure your robot’s safety by preventing falls. These sensors are so precise that they may occasionally recognize dark-colored carpets as a drop, triggering the fall-prevention function and causing the robot to stop working on those areas. While we work on a permanent solution, we can offer a temporary workaround to help maintain uninterrupted cleaning.
You can use the SwitchBot App to mark the dark carpet areas, allowing the K10+ Pro to continue cleaning those zones without interruption. Here’s how you can set it up:
- Open the SwitchBot App.
- Tap your K10+ Pro robot.
- Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- Go to "Vacuum Mode".
- Mark the areas with black carpets.
Important Note:
When you mark black-carpet areas for cleaning, the cliff sensor sensitivity will decrease. If you have staircases or other potential hazards nearby, we recommend setting those areas as "No-Go Zones" instead of marking them as dark carpet areas to prevent accidents.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding as we work towards a permanent solution. If you need further assistance or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
