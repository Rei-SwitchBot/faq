Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Make sure the dust bag is correctly installed. Open the lid of the dual empty station, remove and reinsert the dust bag, and adjust its position if necessary. Proper installation will cause the orange light to blink three times as confirmation ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8uw7jBzZwsT0Hl8swe2kYFxZOP-iUMz/view)).

### Troubleshooting After turning off the base from the power source, the robot leaves the base and starts spinning around itself forever

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding the issue, could you please check the following points?
