### SwitchBot Camera Cloud Storage Service User Agreement

SwitchBot Camera Cloud Storage Service User Agreement

Updated date: May 5, 2023

This agreement is between the provider/operator of SwitchBot products/services (hereinafter referred to as "SwitchBot" or "us", including Wonderlabs Inc., and its parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates) and all users (including but not limited to individuals, teams, etc., hereinafter referred to as "user" or "users") who use cloud storage services provided by SwitchBot. The agreement stipulates the use of cloud storage services and related services. This agreement applies to any cloud storage service provided by SwitchBot (hereinafter referred to as "cloud storage service" or "the service"), including the upgrades of various services and software used by users within the term of this agreement, use of any cloud storage service constitutes acceptance of all terms of this agreement.

The special terms used in this agreement are uniformly interpreted as follows:

App: an application that can access SwitchBot products or services, provided by SwitchBot.

SwitchBot Camera: All models of camera series provided by SwitchBot.

1. Service content and usage instructions

1.1 Cloud storage service is a network service dedicated to storing SwitchBot Camera event recording videos that requires users to subscribe on the App. It provides users with online services such as event recording video storage, synchronization, management and sharing through cloud storage service technology. Once the user activates any service plan, SwitchBot Camera will automatically start uploading event recording videos. We promise that the stored data is limited to the cloud storage service selected by the user and within a limited service cycle (for example, the service cycle paid annually is 365 days, the service paid monthly is 30 days), and SwitchBot shall permanently delete the user's data after the expiration of the user's data recording period (for example, 30 days). During the recording period, the user can access, download or delete the user's data through the App. We acknowledge that users have rights to their data, and nothing in this agreement gives SwitchBot any ownership rights of users' data. In the cloud storage service, SwitchBot itself shall not upload or provide content directly, and shall not modify or edit any content transmitted by users.

1.2 According to the actual situation (such as different countries or regions), the service plans we provide to users may be different. For a service plan with a free trial service period, the trial period starts after the user activates the cloud storage service for the first time, and we will not deduct any fees during the free trial service period. During the trial service period, the user can cancel the overall service plan at any time, but can continue to enjoy the trial service until the end of the trial service period. The final interpretation of the free trial service belongs to SwitchBot. SwitchBot has the right to modify or cancel the free trial service corresponding to each service plan at any time, and has no obligation to notify users in advance, but it will not affect users who have started the free trial.

1.3 On the day when the free trial service ends, we will activate the service plan subscribed by the user through automatic renewal, and we will deduct the service fee from the financial account bounded by the user when he subscribes the service. The amount of the service fee depends on the service plan the user selected on the App.

The service cycle of monthly payment is 30 days. If the user does not cancel the service plan before the expiration of the service cycle, we will continue to provide the service of the next service cycle through automatic renewal on the day the service cycle expires and deduct the service fee of the next service cycle.

The service period of the annual payment is 365 days. If the user does not cancel the service plan before the expiration of the service period, we will continue to provide the service of the next service period through automatic renewal on the day the service period expires and deduct the service fee of the next service period.

The data records are updated on a rolling basis during the service cycle, that is, we will always save the data within the last 30 days for the user, and the data beyond the 30 days will be rolled over as time goes forward.

1.4 If the user activates the plan, the necessary payment information, such as details of a bound credit or debit card (Payment Instrument) is required to make the payment. Please note that we do not store the details of the Payment Instrument, but third parties that provide payment services (e.g. PayPal or Stripe) do. The user authorizes us to charge the Payment Instrument the fees applicable to its plan when the user provides the Payment Instrument.

The user is responsible for keeping the details of his Payment Instrument correct and up-to-date, especially when changing a different Payment Instrument or the Payment Instrument has expired. The user agrees: when the user's Payment Instrument expires or becomes invalid and does not update the Payment Instrument or cancel the subscription, the user authorizes us to cancel the subscription by the next billing date.

1.5 If the user has activated an auto-renewed subscription, we will automatically charge the user's Payment Instrument monthly/yearly (depending on the billing cycle of the subscription) on the calendar day (the Billing Date) corresponding to the subscription date (or the day when the free trial service ends). Users may change their plan to another plan when the term of that plan has expired. We may adjust the content and price of the service plan as needed, but the changes will not affect users who have subscribed to the service plan.

1.6 Once the user activates a subscription plan, the fees for that billing cycle will not be refunded upon cancellation. If the user wants to cancel the auto-renewal, the user should cancel the subscription at least 3 calendar days before the next billing date to avoid being charged for the next billing cycle. Otherwise, the cancellation will take effect after the next billing date and the user will still be charged for the next billing cycle.

1.7 The user understands that the cloud storage service only provides relevant network services, the equipment related to the relevant network services (such as personal computers, mobile phones, and other devices related to accessing the Internet or mobile network) and the required fees (such as telephone charges and Internet access charges for accessing the Internet, and mobile phone charges for using mobile networks) should be borne by users themselves.

2. Ownership

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Pan Tilt Cam Plus 3K Has Activated the Full-Color With Low Light Function, but the Image Is Not in Color.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The full-color with low light feature is not the same as night vision. This function allows your Pan Tilt Cam Plus 3K to display color images in dimly lit environments—whereas cameras without this feature would switch to black-and-white in the same conditions.
For full-color with low light mode to work, some ambient light is still required. Here’s how it operates:
- When lighting conditions go from bright to dark, the camera will maintain color images as long as the brightness stays at or above 1 lux.
- When transitioning from dark to brighter conditions, the camera will remain in black-and-white until the brightness reaches 3–4 lux, at which point color is restored.
Please note that if the surrounding light does not meet these thresholds, the camera will stay in black-and-white mode even with Full-color with low light enabled. We appreciate your understanding of this technical limitation.
If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Please make sure that motion tracking is turned on by going to SwitchBot App → your Camera→ Features. If it's already enabled, disable it briefly and then re-enable it.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Pan Tilt Cam Plus 3K Stops Tracking Motions

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
To maintain more stable operation, the camera will automatically restart every Wednesday between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM (PST). The reboot process takes approximately 35 to 80 seconds, during which the camera may emit a "buzzing" sound and slight vibrations (similar to the vibration of a mobile phone). This is a normal operation of the product and not a malfunction. We kindly ask for your understanding regarding this matter.
If the restart of your camera is not the above phenomenon, please check the following:
- Make sure to use a 5V2A power adapter with the camera.
- Check if the camera is rebooting more than three times per week.

The camera's surface may feel warmer than room temperature during normal use because its internal electronic components are operating. This is a common characteristic of electric devices, similar to how a smartphone generates heat after extended use. Particularly, our cameras are designed to operate continuously for 24 hours, so a certain amount of heat generation due to constant power supply is considered normal.
However, if the heat level is noticeably increasing or the surface becomes too hot to touch, it could indicate the possibility of aging or other issues. To better understand the situation, we would appreciate it if you could provide the following details:
- The current room temperature  
- A warmth that is either comfortable to the touch or hot enough to feel upon contact
- If possible, the measured surface temperature of the camera

### Troubleshooting not realizing that the cloud storage service for Pan Tilt Cam Plus series and Traditional cameras was not compatible before buying, so now I can't use it.

TThank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. SwitchBot cameras are divided into the Plus Camera series and the traditional Camera series, and the cloud storage plans are not compatible between them, which means if you own both an Outdoor Spotlight Cam and a Pan/Tilt Cam Plus 2K, you'll need to purchase separate cloud storage plans for each series.

- Traditional Camera series: SwitchBot Indoor Cam, SwitchBot Pan/Tilt Cam, SwitchBot Pan/Tilt Cam 2K, SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Cam, SwitchBot Outdoor Spotlight Cam 2K

### Troubleshooting Cloud Storage Plan for More Than 10 SwitchBot Pan Tilt Cam Plus 3Ks

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.

- Indoor Cam
- Pan Tilt Cam
