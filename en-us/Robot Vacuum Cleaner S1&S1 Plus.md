### Use voice command to control the SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner over Alexa Custom Skill

After connecting the SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner to a stable network, we can activate it using voice command on Alexa. But we can only do some simple actions like turn on or turn off the Cleaner.

In order to enrich the capability, we have implemented Custom Skills on Alexa for the SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner, which allows us to make the Robot Vacuum Cleaner realize more functions by voice command.

Here is the way to use voice command to control the SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner via Alexa Custom Skill.

One-sentence command

We can just say to Alexa: "Alexa, ask switch bot to xxxx." Then Alexa will tell the SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner to do the corresponding command. If you have multiple SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaners in the account, all the cleaners will be activated at the same time. (Here we should say "switch bot" to refer to the Cleaner. Otherwise, Alexa will not recognize the sentence.)

Two-sentence command

1. Firstly, we need to enter the "Custom Skill Mode" by saying: "Alexa, open switch bot."

2. When Alexa has responded, we can say to Alexa: "Ask

Living Room Cleaner*

to xxxx." Then Alexa will tell the SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner to do the corresponding command. (*Please note that we need to use the name we set for the Cleaner on the SwitchBot App. If we name the Cleaner as Smart Cleaner, we should say "Ask Smart Cleaner to xxxx." )

Note: We need to say the exact words in the sentence to activate the corresponding action. If we say a different sentence with the same meaning, Alexa will not recognize the sentence and does know what to do.

Please refer to the table below to see the voice command for each action.

Actions

### What Is the Virtual Walls of SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner?

Updated: Feb 19th, 2023

Applicable Products: SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner S1, Robot Vacuum Cleaner S1 Plus

SwitchBot App Version: V6.17 or newer

Our Robot Vacuum Cleaner will hit full-length mirrors very hard, but why?

Because the SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner will emit laser beams to detect surroundings, full-length mirrors reflect the laser beams emitted by the Robot vacuum cleaner, so the mirror itself cannot be perceived as a wall. Besides, it is easily perceived as an entrance to the room, which makes it easier to be hit.

But we can set a virtual wall in the SwitchBot App to solve this problem. If you create a virtual wall in front of a full-length mirror, collision with the mirror is eliminated. The below picture shows how to set this up.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/26002275809559)

Furniture with short legs can also be prevented from colliding with the same virtual wall support, but if use a height aid part, as shown in the picture below, is used to create a path for the Robot Vacuum Cleaner body to pass through, the cleaning will be possible.

### What Should I do If the Network Configuration Failed?

(1) Check whether the side switch of the robot is turned on.

(2) The robot can be only connected to a 2.4G Wi-Fi but but not to a 5G Wi-Fi, so please connect your phone to a 2.4G Wi-Fi.

(3) For iPhones with iOS 13 and above, please enable the location permission for the APP.

(4) Please disable cellular data and enable only Wi-Fi connection before robot network configuration.

(5) For Android phones, please enable all permissions for SwitchBot APP.

(6) Make sure to enable the wireless SSID broadcasting on your router.

---
### What are the features in the Edit map function?

When the robot builds the floor map for the first time, it will divide the house into several rooms or zones. This can be edited in your APP by going to Advanced Features - Room Partition. You can divide a room, merge rooms, rename or even repartition in the floor plan.



---
### What do the accessories and sensor percentages on the front page of the robot cleaner represent?

(1) Side brush, filter, brush roll, disposable dust bag, etc. are all consumables.

They can be wore and tore after using for sometime. The percentage numbers of side brush, filter, and brush roll on the homepage are indicators of how much service life is left for this particular component. When the remaining service life is dropped to less than 20%, please change the component in time.

(2) The percentage numbers of sensors on the homepage are not the percentage of remaining service life but the percentage of unstained area on the sensor.

If the number has dropped to less than 20%, please wipe the sensor clean with a soft cloth.

### What should I do if the map of SwitchBot  Robot Vacuum Cleaner overlaps?

Updated: Nov 17th, 2022

Applicable Products:

SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner S1、

SwitchBot Robot Vacuum Cleaner S1 Plus

SwitchBot App Version:

V6.19 or newer

Reason:

1. If the room layouts are similar/hallways are very long, the main body of the Robot Vacuum Cleaner will get lost.

2. When operating on the watery ground in the water-wiping mode, the main body of the robot vacuum cleaner slips or gets stuck, causing the constructed map to tilt and overlap.

3. If the main body of the Robot Vacuum Cleaner does not escape from the stuck position, the maps will easily overlap.

Countermeasures:

1. Rebuild the map.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/26002106290071)

2. Press the Clean button. When cleaning is complete, a map is automatically generated

.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/26002106291735)

3. From the "Details" menu, go to "Map Management" to delete old maps and save new ones.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/12652841869847)

Recurrence prevention measure:

1. If you have rooms with similar layouts or long hallways, set up a small chest/heavy cardboard-like object on the floor and observe how the Robot Vacuum Cleaner gets lost or drives.

2. It is recommended to set up a no-entry area (or set up a virtual wall) in areas where it is easy to get caught.

3. Please avoid using the Robot Vacuum Cleaner on damp ground.
