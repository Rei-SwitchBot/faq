### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Roller Shade Fabric Has Black Stains

We’re sorry to hear that your SwitchBot Roller Shade fabric has black stains. In rare cases, slight marks may appear during production or shipping, but don’t worry—there are ways to resolve this issue.
Gently rub a soft eraser over the affected area to remove the stains. This method is effective in most cases and won’t damage the fabric.
If the eraser does not fully remove the marks but the roller shade functions properly, we’d like to offer you a goodwill gesture. You can choose between:
- A 15% refund on your purchase price (Please note that any processing fees incurred from the refund will not be covered by us).
- A free gift—select one from the following options: Meter, Remote, or Bot.
If you give this a try, please let us know the results and which option you’d prefer. We’re here to assist you!

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Roller Shade Fabric Has Creases or Wrinkles

We’re sorry to hear that your SwitchBot Roller Shade has developed creases. Fabric wrinkles can sometimes occur due to packaging, shipping, prolonged rolling, or even during installation, but don’t worry—there are ways to smooth them out.
The best way to remove creases is by gently steaming the fabric with a garment steamer. Lightly run the steamer along the wrinkled areas while keeping the fabric taut. This method has been tested and works effectively.
If steaming does not fully remove the creases or you don’t have a garment steamer, we can arrange a fabric replacement for you. However, since the fabric is shipped from our Hong Kong warehouse, delivery may take some time. For a faster solution, we recommend purchasing the fabric locally, and we will cover the cost.
Note: When choosing your shade fabric, remember:
1. Fabric Roll Diameter: The diameter of the rolled-up fabric, including the rod, should not exceed 66mm.
2. Fabric Weight: Keep the fabric weight under 3kg to avoid putting too much strain on the Roller Shade and affecting its performance.

### Troubleshooting The Brush on SwitchBot Robot Vacuum K10+ Pro Combo Nozzle Appears to Be Bent Out of Shape.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by our product.
Upon checking, we found that the deformation of the brush on the nozzle was caused by pressure from the screwdriver inside the packaging.
To restore the brush to its original shape, please try softening the bristles with hot water at approximately 80°C (176°F), then gently straighten them and allow them to dry completely. Please be careful to avoid burns during this process.
If the brush does not return to its original condition after trying the above method, we will arrange for a replacement nozzle to be sent to you. Please feel free to contact us.
Once again, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Please rest assured that we have already improved the packaging to prevent this issue from happening in the future.
Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

### Troubleshooting Guide for Constant Orange Light on Dual Dust Collection Station

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Make sure the dust bag is correctly installed. Open the lid of the dual empty station, remove and reinsert the dust bag, and adjust its position if necessary. Proper installation will cause the orange light to blink three times as confirmation ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8uw7jBzZwsT0Hl8swe2kYFxZOP-iUMz/view)).
2. Make sure the lid of the dual empty station is properly positioned. Avoid reversing the front and back sides, as this can interfere with detection.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33d8b4c3-c684-48c0-80f2-95caf571004e)

3. Remove the dust bag and close the lid of the dual empty station. If the lid is correctly detected, the orange light will blink three times ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fO6RbkA_VQiXQH-BbipsSUgJMxAKikHS/view)).
Note: Since the dust bag is not installed, the orange light will remain constantly on afterward.
4. Remove the rubber on the back of the lid and use a magnet or metal object to check for the built-in magnet [(video)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EcDYoNKmhX_hGfgRRgpbSWqaYSptDHUL/view). If it's missing, please contact our support team through the SwitchBot App to get a replacement lid.

### Instructions for SwitchBot Robot Vacuum K10+ Pro Combo Do-Not-Disturb Time Feature

Setting the Do Not Disturb Time:
Launch SwitchBot App and log in.
Tap your K10+ Pro Combo.
Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.
Select "Do Not Disturb" from the settings menu.
Add the desired time period and save the settings.

Maximum Number of Do Not Disturb Times:
You can set up to 10 Do Not Disturb times.

How Do Not Disturb Time Works:
During the scheduled Do Not Disturb Time, the Robot Vacuum K10+ Pro Combo will not clean automatically, including scheduled tasks and automations. It will also not activate automatic dust collection. Moreover, the voice prompt volume will be lowered and the indicator lights dimmed to minimize interruptions.
The Do Not Disturb Time settings are saved directly on the robot. This means that the vacuum must be connected to the dual empty station in order to sync these settings with the cordless vacuum cleaner. If the cordless vacuum cleaner is docked during a Do Not Disturb Time while the robot is connected to the dual empty station, dust collection will not be performed. However, if the robot is not connected to the dual empty station, such as when it is actively cleaning, docking the cordless vacuum cleaner will still trigger dust collection. This behavior occurs because the Do Not Disturb Time settings are not synced in this scenario and should be considered a normal operational feature rather than a product defect. Thank you for your understanding.
To sum it up:
Do Not Disturb Time + robot connected to the dual empty station → automatic dust collection of the cordless vacuum cleaner will not be performed
Do Not Disturb Time + robot is not connected to the dual empty station → automatic dust collection will be performed

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Robot Vacuum K10+ Pro Combo's Cliff Sensor Functions Immediately and Failed to Map When Maping with Dark Carpet

In this situation, we'd like to guide you to a temporary solution as below.
1. Stick the cliff sensor flat with thin, white tape as shown in the figure to prevent it from functioning.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d595f3e2-d82f-4cac-8940-a0b5b6d99b51)

2. Before mapping, make sure to physically block off any steps, such as stairs or doorways. Otherwise, there is a risk that the robot will fall because the step sensor won't work.
3. Perform mapping.
4. After mapping, mark the dark carpet areas in the following order, allowing your robot to clean those zones without interruption.
- Open the SwitchBot App.
- Tap your S10 robot.
- Tap the map icon in the center-left of the screen.
- Go to "Edit Floor".
- Select "Carpet Cleaning" and then "Carpet Settings".
- Mark the areas with dark-colored carpets.
5. When you mark dark-colored areas for cleaning, the cliff sensor sensitivity will decrease. If you have staircases or other potential hazards nearby, we recommend setting those areas as "No-Go Zones" instead of marking them as dark carpet areas to prevent accidents.
(Please remove the tape when you are done mapping.)
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

### Troubleshooting Rubber Caps Are Missing in SwitchBot Robot Vacuum K10+ Pro Combo Package

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by our product.
Regarding this issue, we would like to explain the situation with the silicone plugs:
These small accessories were originally included to protect the four screw heads. However, after receiving thoughtful feedback about removal difficulties (especially when the plugs fit too snugly), we made a conscious choice to simplify the design.
Here's what we've implemented:
• Removed the plugs entirely from newer production batches
• All manuals now reflect this change (we've retired old instructions mentioning the plugs)
• Confirmed through testing that your vacuum works perfectly without them
If your manual still shows plug-related information, you can safely ignore those pages. We're sorry for any confusion this outdated content might have caused.
This experience has taught us to better balance protective design with user convenience. We've added new checkpoints in our production process to catch such details earlier.
Please know we're always here if you notice anything else or just want to share suggestions. Your perspective makes our products better for everyone.
