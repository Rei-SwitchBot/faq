### Troubleshooting When I Tried To Shape SwitchBot RGBIC Neon Wire Rope Light, Part of It Stopped Lighting Up.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Before installation, please check the condition of the installation surface, such as walls, desk edges, or display stands. The installation surface should be dry, clean, and flat. In particular, in high-humidity environments or on uneven surfaces, the weight of the wire neon light itself may cause it to fall.  
2. Please avoid making significant shape adjustments midway through the installation, as this can place strain on the product. Plan in advance how you intend to position the RGBIC Wire Neon Light, and try to complete the shaping in a single step. 
3. Shape it into smooth curves, avoiding sharp bends or excessive twisting.  
4. Bending the same section repeatedly may result in internal wire or circuit damage. When installing, apply force gradually and avoid pulling forcibly.  
5. Please note that installation using the double-sided tape is not suitable for environments with high temperatures, high humidity, or rough wall surfaces. Thank you for your understanding.
