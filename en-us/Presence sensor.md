### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Presence Sensor Reached the Set Time for Space Unoccupied, But the Light Did Not Immediately Turn Off

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The default setting for the Presence Sensor's unoccupied timer is 15 seconds. When the space is occupied, a 15-second countdown starts before it switches to unoccupied. For instance, if the automation condition requires a space-occupied time of 1 minute, the light action will be triggered at least 1 minute and 15 seconds later. Additional time may be needed depending on network connection. We appreciate your understanding.
If there is significant delay in action execution or if the actions are not being performed, please contact us again.

### Troubleshooting the Automation of Turning off the Lights When SwitchBot Presence Sensor Is Space-Unoccupied Triggers Very Slowly

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
When using "Space Unoccupied" as a condition in automations, the time it takes for actions to execute depends heavily on the "Unoccupied Timer" setting. To check or adjust this timer, please go to SwitchBot app -> Presence Sensor -> Gear Icon -> Detection Sensitivity -> Unoccupied Timer.
By default, the Unoccupied Timer is set to 15 seconds. If your automation is set to trigger when "Space-unoccupied for longer than 1 min", the action will take at least 1 minute and 15 seconds to run. Similarly, if the Unoccupied Timer is set to 3 minutes and your automation uses the condition "Presence Sensor is Space-Unoccupied", it will take at least 3 minutes before the associated action (such as turning off a light) is triggered.
We recommend adjusting the Unoccupied Timer based on your environment and preferences to better suit your automation needs.
If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out, we're always happy to help.

### Troubleshooting I Have Already Left the Detection Range of SwitchBot Presence Sensor, but It Still Shows "Space-Occupied" And Cannot Switch to "Space-Unoccupied".

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Please check if you have moved the Presence Sensor or added any new appliances or furniture within its detection range. If you relocate the sensor or rearrange the room, we suggest re-running the "Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity" feature to recalibrate it for accurate performance in the new environment.
You can use this feature by going to SwitchBot app → Presence Sensor → Gear icon → Detection Sensitivity → Auto Adjust.
2. If there are no changes in the installation position or layout, first adjust the angle of the device and then check if sensitivity improves by readjusting it with the "Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity" function.
