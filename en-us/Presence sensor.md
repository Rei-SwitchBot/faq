### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Presence Sensor Reached the Set Time for Space Unoccupied, But the Light Did Not Immediately Turn Off

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The default setting for the Presence Sensor's unoccupied timer is 15 seconds. When the space is occupied, a 15-second countdown starts before it switches to unoccupied. For instance, if the automation condition requires a space-occupied time of 1 minute, the light action will be triggered at least 1 minute and 15 seconds later. Additional time may be needed depending on network connection. We appreciate your understanding.
If there is significant delay in action execution or if the actions are not being performed, please contact us again.
