### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Presence Sensor Reached the Set Time for Space Unoccupied, But the Light Did Not Immediately Turn Off

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The default setting for the Presence Sensor's unoccupied timer is 15 seconds. When the space is occupied, a 15-second countdown starts before it switches to unoccupied. For instance, if the automation condition requires a space-occupied time of 1 minute, the light action will be triggered at least 1 minute and 15 seconds later. Additional time may be needed depending on network connection. We appreciate your understanding.
If there is significant delay in action execution or if the actions are not being performed, please contact us again.

### Troubleshooting the Automation of Turning off the Lights When SwitchBot Presence Sensor Is Space-Unoccupied Triggers Very Slowly

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
When using "Space Unoccupied" as a condition in automations, the time it takes for actions to execute depends heavily on the "Unoccupied Timer" setting. To check or adjust this timer, please go to SwitchBot app -> Presence Sensor -> Gear Icon -> Detection Sensitivity -> Unoccupied Timer.
By default, the Unoccupied Timer is set to 15 seconds. If your automation is set to trigger when "Space-unoccupied for longer than 1 min", the action will take at least 1 minute and 15 seconds to run. Similarly, if the Unoccupied Timer is set to 3 minutes and your automation uses the condition "Presence Sensor is Space-Unoccupied", it will take at least 3 minutes before the associated action (such as turning off a light) is triggered.
We recommend adjusting the Unoccupied Timer based on your environment and preferences to better suit your automation needs.
If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out, we're always happy to help.

### Troubleshooting I Have Already Left the Detection Range of SwitchBot Presence Sensor, but It Still Shows "Space-Occupied" And Cannot Switch to "Space-Unoccupied".

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Please check if you have moved the Presence Sensor or added any new appliances or furniture within its detection range. If you relocate the sensor or rearrange the room, we suggest re-running the "Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity" feature to recalibrate it for accurate performance in the new environment.
You can use this feature by going to SwitchBot app → Presence Sensor → Gear icon → Detection Sensitivity → Auto Adjust.
2. If there are no changes in the installation position or layout, first adjust the angle of the device and then check if sensitivity improves by readjusting it with the "Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity" function.

### Can I Install SwitchBot Presence Sensor on the Balcony?

Please do not use the Presence Sensor outdoors or on balconies as air flow, glass reflections, and hanging clothes can interfere with the sensor and affect its performance. Also, if the temperature in the operating environment is too high, PIR detection may not work properly. 


---
### Can I Install SwitchBot Presence Sensor in My Bathroom?

The Presence Sensor can be installed and used in toilets or bathrooms. Normally, even if some water splashes and droplets land on the Presence Sensor, it will not affect the device. However, please do not submerge the device in water.
Note:
The Presence Sensor is not equipped with a camera lens and microphone, so it will not capture images, record sound, or take videos. There is no need to worry about privacy from this perspective.


---
### How Long Can SwitchBot Presence Sensor Batteries Last?

If the Presence Sensor detects movement 10 times a day, with each detection lasting 30 minutes, its two AAA batteries will last approximately two years.
Note:
The above estimates are based on SwitchBot laboratory test conditions and may differ depending on actual usage environments.

### Can SwitchBot Presence Sensor Be Used without a Hub?

If you want to use the Presence Sensor to trigger other devices with SwitchBot automation, you will need to purchase one of our hub products. However, even without a hub, you can still connect directly to devices like Bots, Curtains, and Color Bulbs using Bluetooth communication. Feel free to use the Presence Sensor as needed.
Note:
Up to 2 local linkages can be created.
Each local linkage can be configured for only one device, multiple device triggers are not supported.

### Will the Cats and Dogs at Home Affect the Detection of SwitchBot Presence Sensor?

Dogs and cats, which have body temperatures similar to humans, may trigger motion detection by the Presence Sensor when they run around the house, causing it to determine its status as "space-occupied". To avoid such situations, we recommend installing the Presence Sensor upside down (with the pairing button facing downwards as shown in the diagram).

<img width="768" height="534" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e1f4de-8d55-41fc-b63a-6978b3894894" />

### What Is SwitchBot Presence Sensor's Unoccupied Timer?

The "Unoccupied Timer" of the Presence Sensor refers to the duration of time when a person leaves the sensor detection range, and the state of "Space Unoccupied" continues.
You can set this timer for anywhere between 5 seconds and 3 minutes by going to SwitchBot App → Presence Sensor → Gear Icon → Detection Settings → Unoccupied Timer.
If the "Unoccupied Timer" setting is too short (e.g. 5 seconds), it may mistakenly switch to "Space Unoccupied" when someone is still present. Conversely, if set too long (e.g. 3 minutes), it will take a certain amount of time to reach "Space Unoccupied", but accuracy is high and mistakes are less likely. It is recommended to set the timer at 15 or 30 seconds for optimal use in different scenarios.
"Space Unoccupied" can be used as a SwitchBot automation condition to trigger other devices. We use setting the "Unoccupied Timer" time to 3 minutes as an example to explain the specific logic of automation triggering.
When: Space unoccupied for longer than 1 min
Perform: Turn off Color Bulb
When we leave the detection range of the presence sensor and after a preset "unoccupied timer" time of 3 minutes, it meets the condition of "Space unoccupied". In addition, after another 60 seconds, the Color Bulb will automatically turn off. Which means under this automation, the Color Bulb  will automatically turn off in at least four minutes.
Please note that the shorter the set time of the "Unoccupied Timer", the faster the battery consumption rate. We appreciate your understanding!

### How Many Luxes of Brightness Can SwitchBot Presence Sensor Detect?

SwitchBot Presence Sensor can detect brightness up to 1000 lux, and the illumination level is approximately 20. In the SwitchBot app, it is displayed as illumination levels from 1 to 20 instead of in lux units.

<img width="1011" height="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efd1f5d6-d012-4520-9740-1be7ee6d897e" />

### When Should I Use the Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity Function of SwitchBot Presence Sensor?

The "Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity" feature in the Presence Sensor works by having the device record energy variations across different distances within its detection range. Based on these readings, it automatically sets an appropriate detection threshold. When a person enters the area, the energy level at the corresponding distance increases. If it exceeds the set threshold, the sensor will recognize this as motion detection (space-occupied).
If you change the installation location of the sensor or rearrange the room layout, we recommend running the "Auto-Adjust Detection Sensitivity" feature again. This allows the sensor to recalibrate and adapt to the new environment, ensuring it continues to work accurately.
You can use this feature by going to SwitchBot app → Presence Sensor → Gear icon → Detection Sensitivity → Auto Adjust.

### Can I Use My Motion Sensor Base to SwitchBot Presence Sensor?

The mounting holes on the base and main unit of the Presence Sensor are oval-shaped. If the motion sensor you have is an older version with a round-shaped base, it will not be compatible with the Presence Sensor. However, the latest motion sensors have oval-shaped bases and mounting holes for compatibility. Please check compatibility based on the shape.  
The diagram below shows the oval-shaped design of the Presence Sensor.
