### How Many Smartphones Can One SwitchBot Smart Video Doorbell Be Added To?

For security reasons, each smart video doorbell can only be linked to one SwitchBot app account. The device is not registered directly to a smartphone, but is instead stored under your account.
If multiple smartphones share the same SwitchBot account, they can all access the doorbell. However, if you need to grant access to a different account (e.g., for family members), please use the Home Sharing feature instead.

### Do I Need a Hub for Remote Unlocking via the App if I Have SwitchBot Smart Video Doorbell and Lock?

Note: 
The doorbell’s hub function only works with Lock series products and does not support remote control for other SwitchBot devices (such as Bot or Curtain).
