1. Please use the latest version of the SwitchBot app from the app store. You may not be able to pair with the beta version.
2. If you are using mesh Wi-Fi, please check whether the Video Doorbell can connect to your smartphone's hotspot. If you can successfully add the device via hotspot, the device itself is not faulty, and the issue can be resolved with a Wi-Fi repeater. In that case, please provide a detailed explanation of the situation when contacting after-sales service.

6.  If you can connect to other Wi-Fi networks or use smartphone tethering, the issue is likely not with the doorbell. Please consider replacing your home router or requesting a return and refund.
7.  Please ensure that your smartphone or other SwitchBot Wi-Fi devices are properly connected to the network.
8. Please review the following information about your home router settings.
Please do not use WPA3 encryption.
Wi-Fi must have a password.
Hidden Wi-Fi is not supported.
Disable the any function related to VPN and try again.

### Troubleshooting the Doorbell and Monitor Are Connected Using Low-Voltage Wires, but the Power of the Doorbell Has Decreased Instead.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.

5. If the Wi-Fi connection is unstable, the device will constantly attempt to connect to Wi-Fi, causing the battery to drain faster. Please make sure there are no more than two walls or doors between the doorbell and monitor, or the monitor and router. Use the device within 10 meters of the router when possible. Keep the distance between the monitor and doorbell as short as possible for stable communication.
6. The battery drains faster when many events occur in front of the camera lens. Adjust detection settings like time zone, area, low sensitivity, or long trigger interval to improve this.
Low sensitivity: 1~3 meters
Medium sensitivity: 4~6 meters
High sensitivity: 7~9 meters
7. If there are lots of events, please check for changes in light (such as glass or direct sunlight) and subtle movements (such as air conditioner vents, curtains, or fans) in front of the doorbell. These factors can lead to battery drain.
8. If the temperature is extremely high or low, it can affect battery life. For example, at -20°C, the battery may decrease by 40% to 50%.

### Troubleshooting I Set the Doorbell to Answer Automatically When Guests Arrive, but the "Auto Reply" Feature Isn't Working.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Please refer to the link below and review the settings again.
[https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/31601503495319](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/31601503495319)
2. Please verify if you are using the Video Doorbell with Alexa. If they are already linked, pressing the doorbell triggers Alexa's stream acquisition, and calls on the Alexa side take priority over the "Auto Reply" feature. As a result, the doorbell's speaker will be used for Alexa call, and the "Auto Reply" voice will not be heard. This behavior is a specification of the Video Doorbell and not a malfunction. We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.
