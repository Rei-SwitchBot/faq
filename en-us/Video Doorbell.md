For example, if the call button is pressed on the monitor, communication will be possible from the monitor, but in that case, the add-on monitor will only display the video.

Under normal network conditions, the video feed synchronization between multiple monitors is nearly instantaneous, though minimal delays may occur depending on your specific network environment.
