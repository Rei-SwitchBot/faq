SwitchBot App Version: 9.0 or newer
SwitchBot App

For Android users, ensure that the SwitchBot App's battery usage is set to unrestricted in order to update the location information for your finder card. For iOS users, allow background app refresh for the SwitchBot App.

https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/29085264177431

When your Finder Card is within the Bluetooth range of your phone, SwitchBot App updates its location every 10 minutes. If it’s outside your phone’s Bluetooth range, the App will display the last location where your phone detected the card via Bluetooth.

If the Finder Card is near your phone but the location hasn’t updated for a while, please tap the card in the SwitchBot App and check if the Bluetooth icon on the map page is red. If it’s red, press the button on the Wallet Finder Card and wait for a beep, which should trigger an update.

If the location still doesn’t update after pressing the button, please send us a screenshot of the map page and contact us via SwitchBot App > Profile > Support >Feedback. We will forward your feedback to our development team for further assistance.

Apple Find My App

In Apple’s Find My App, the Wallet Finder Card does not update its location in real-time. Instead, it relies on nearby Apple devices to track its location. The frequency of updates depends on the availability of Apple’s network and whether an iPhone detects the signal from the Finder Card.

In places with lots of iPhones around, the location may update every few minutes. However, in areas where there are fewer iPhones, it might take longer—sometimes 15 or 30 minutes, or even more. These intervals are not consistent and can be influenced by external factors beyond your control.

For more information about how Find My App works, we recommend checking Apple’s official documentation on below.

### Why Do I Keep Receiving Notifications From SwitchBot App about the Foreground Service Being Enabled?

Last Updated: 2024 Sep 24

Related Product: SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card

SwitchBot App Version: 9.1 or newer

Smartphone OS: Android

When using the SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card, you may receive a notification on your Android device saying, "Foreground service enabled" This is because the SwitchBot app needs to run in the background to continuously update the location of the Wallet Finder Card.

Due to Android system restrictions, the app must notify users when it’s running in the background.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

To ensure the location updates and the “Find My Phone” feature work correctly, please set the SwitchBot app's battery usage to "Unrestricted".

Note:

If the battery usage for SwitchBot is not set to "Unrestricted," you will see a pop-up notification every time you launch the SwitchBot app. For a better experience, we recommend setting the battery usage to "Unrestricted".

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/26580066006551)

How to adjust the settings:

Go to Android System Settings App → Apps → All Apps → SwitchBot → Battery → Change from Optimization to "Unrestricted". (Note: The exact steps may vary depending on your device model.)

### Troubleshooting Not Receiving Notifications When Leaving My Wallet Finder Card at Home

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, I'd like to explain how the Wallet Finder Card notifications work on Android:
When your finder card is within Bluetooth range of your smartphone (nearby), the SwitchBot app updates its location every 10 minutes. However, if the card is placed where your phone can't detect it (out of Bluetooth range), the app will only show the last known location where the connection was active. After that, the position won't update until the card is back in range.
If you want to get notifications when you leave your finder card behind, make sure you're using SwitchBot app version 9.9 or later. Then, tap the finder card on the app and enable the "Lost Notifications (Beta)" feature.
If you have any other questions, feel free to contact us for help.
