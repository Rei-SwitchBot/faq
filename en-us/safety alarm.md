### Troubleshooting My Child Will Bring a Safety Alarm to School, and I Am Worried That It Might Accidentally Go Off in Class and Alert the Teacher's Phone.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
If you add the safety alarm to the Apple Find My app and it does not reconnect to your iPhone or iPad within 72 hours, the device will emit intermittent warning sounds lasting 15-20 seconds when motion is detected. To resolve this, we recommend connecting the device to your iPhone or iPad daily. If the device starts sounding, pressing the button on the safety alarm itself will stop the warning sound.
