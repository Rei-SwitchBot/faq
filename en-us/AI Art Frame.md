Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.

### Troubleshooting the Display Keeps Flickering When Changing Images in SwitchBot AI Art Frame.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
SwitchBot AI Art Frame uses color E Ink electronic paper for its display. Unlike traditional screens, E Ink works by physically moving tiny particles to create each image. During screen updates, this movement can cause brief flickering or temporary remnants of the previous image.
Color E Ink displays typically require a slightly longer refresh time than black-and-white E Ink screens, so these visual effects may be more noticeable in color mode. This behavior is a normal characteristic of E Ink technology and not a malfunction of your device. Please feel assured that your AI Art Frame is working as intended, and you can continue to enjoy it as usual.
If you have any further questions, we're always here to help.

### Troubleshooting After Syncing the Image to SwitchBot AI Art Frame, It Appears Rough and Grainy.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
SwitchBot AI Art Frame uses E Ink Spectra 6 electronic paper to display images. This screen works by physically moving small color particles, much like traditional printed art. Because of this unique technology, you may notice a visible texture or graininess when viewing the screen up close, especially within about 30 cm (12 inches).
This textured appearance, or visible graininess, is a natural characteristic of the screen, not a defect or a sign of low resolution. For the best viewing experience, we recommend enjoying the artwork from a distance of 50 cm (20 inches) or more. At this distance, the particles blend seamlessly, and the artwork appears as intended.
Please also note that the appearance of texture can vary depending on the image content and brightness. Some pictures may show more noticeable grain than others.
We understand that this visual style may be different from what you expected from a digital display, and we sincerely apologize that we are unable to change this aspect of the technology. We genuinely appreciate your understanding and patience as you experience the unique aesthetic of electronic paper.
If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to let us know. We're here to help.

### Troubleshooting When Hanging SwitchBot AI Art Frame Horizontally on the Wall, It Becomes Tilted and Cannot Be Leveled.

Thank you for reaching out to us. 
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the AI Art Frame not hanging level when mounted horizontally. Our R&D team is actively investigating this issue, and we appreciate your patience as we work to improve the product.
In the meantime, we would like to share an alternative mounting method that may help achieve a level display. The video guide linked below demonstrates how adjusting the placement of the adhesive hook, specifically, hooking it over the edge of the device rather than the bracket, can provide better stability and balance.
Video guide: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FiUjgH-iVmnC9rDwKFeCZ5FuDrOcBJMR/view?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FiUjgH-iVmnC9rDwKFeCZ5FuDrOcBJMR/view?usp=drive_link)
Key point: For best results, please ensure the hook is placed over the edge of the frame, not on the central hook area shown in the video.
