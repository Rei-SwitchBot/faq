### How is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) different from regular Bluetooth and what does SwitchBot use?

The "LE" stands for "low energy" and it's one of the primary advantages of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) over other Bluetooth.

BLE leverages a trade-off of range vs connection speed. So the fact that its slower connection speed allows for more range means you couldn't play music across that greater span, but you can effectively transfer small payloads like Meter data. Also, this slower connection speed requirement means the Meter can allocate additional power to tasks more central to the purpose of the device. For example, it makes it possible for the Meter to have a higher sample rate.

Most (battery-powered) SwitchBot products are equipped with BLE capability, so you can use them directly with your mobile phones. Additionally, we also apply our own cutting edge power-saving technology, so you can always enjoy a better battery life experience.

### How to Set Up a Password for the Bot

The SwitchBot Bot is a Bluetooth device that does not need to be paired to a SwitchBot account to use. All we need to do is to get rid of the isolation tag, and it can be detected and accessed.

In that case, it is expected that anybody with a smartphone near this Bot can scan its Bluetooth signal and get to control it.

In order to avoid unwanted control of our Bot, we can set a password to it. After that, even those nearby who scan this Bot cannot control it without a correct password.

Please follow the guide to set a password for the Bot.

1. Find the Bot on the SwitchBot App.

If we did not sign up for a SwitchBot account, the Bot will show up in the Bot Nearby section.

If we have added the Bot to our account, we can find the Bot on either All Devices or the relevant room section.

2. Go to the settings page of the Bot and we can set a password for it.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25996234272023)

3. After setting up the password, there will be a little lock icon at the corner of the Bot on the homepage.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25996203145623)

The first time to control this encrypted Bot, we are required to input the password.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25996203147159)

If we want to change the password, we can go to the password settings to proceed.

If we forget the password somehow, we can reset the Bot and the password will be erased. Please follow the article below to see how to reset the Bot.

### What can the Bot do under the Customized Mode?

Applicable product: SwitchBot Bot

SwitchBot App version: 6.11 or newer

Device firmware version:  6.3 or newer

Go to Bot Settings - Password & Mode, we can set the mode to Customized Mode. Then we can see there are three options below: Action treated as "ON", Action treated as "OFF", and Stop Action.

We should consider action 'ON' and 'OFF' as two individual buttons that can be applied with different commands. Stop Action will stop the Bot from working.

For example:

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25996234609815)

On the 'ON' action, we set the Bot to do the pressing repeatedly every 3 seconds, with no holding time for each press.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25996203474967)

On the 'OFF' action, we set the Bot to do the pressing 4 times. Each press will last for 3 seconds, with 1-second interval in between.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/4406985581207/Lark20210824-175403.jpg)

Now the action 'ON' and 'OFF' have been applied with different commands. On the homepage, we will see there are two buttons for the Bot. When we tap the button 'ON', the Bot will do the pressing repeatedly every 3 seconds, with no holding time. When we tap the button 'OFF', it will do the job accordingly.

These are two simple examples of setting the commands for the Bot under the Customized Mode. With this accessibility, we can create more commands for the Bot to meet our requirements in daily life.

If you are interested, please visit the article

### Why SwitchBot app needs the location permission on Android devices?

Location permission is required for hardware identifier access because of the change of Andriod after Andriod 6.0. Thus, the SwitchBot App must get access to location service to work properly.

If you are using a device with

Android 12 or later

, you will only need to turn on the Bluetooth function , and do NOT need to turn on "Location Permission".

### Troubleshooting Apple Home App Displays SwitchBot Bot as on/off Switch, Even if the Bot’s Mode Is Set to Press.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, we’d like to clarify that currently, third-party applications like Apple Home and Google Home only support Bot’s Switch Mode.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We understand how important seamless integration is for your smart home setup, and we’re actively working to expand compatibility with these third-party services. However, at this time, we’re unable to provide a specific timeline for when this functionality will be available.
