### Can I Use SwitchBot Relay Switch 1 to Control the Air Conditioner Remotely?

Last Updated: 2024 Oct 30

Related Product: SwitchBot Relay Switch 1

We do not recommend using SwitchBot Relay Switch to control an air conditioner. Although most air conditioners operate at around 3.5A during regular use, the initial motor startup can draw a surge current between 11-18A (3-8 times the rated current).

This could activate SwitchBot Relay Switch’s overload protection

, which is triggered when currents exceed 16A.

If your goal is to measure the air conditioner’s power consumption, you can consider using SwitchBot Relay Switch 1PM, which supports this function.

### Over-Temperature Protection in SwitchBot Relay Switch 1

Last Updated: 2024 Oct 31

Related Product: SwitchBot Relay Switch 1

SwitchBot Relay Switch is equipped with an over-temperature protection feature that enhances its safety and durability. If the device’s internal temperature

exceeds

100°C,

the relay will automatically disconnect the input, preventing overheating and potential damage to connected devices.

If over-temperature protection is triggered, you can reset the device by turning off the power and restarting it, which will clear the protection state.

### What Does the Dry Contact on SwitchBot Relay Switch 1 Do?

Last Updated: 2024 Oct 30

Related Product: SwitchBot Relay Switch 1

A dry contact is essentially a relay that acts as an on/off switch without carrying any power itself, allowing it to connect or trigger other devices without interference or electrical risk. For

SwitchBot Relay Switch 1

, the dry contact can be easily applied to operate low-power triggers like

garage doors

and

doorbells

, allowing for remote activation of these devices. This provides a simple, flexible setup for integrating automated control in your home.
