### Can Lock/Lock Pro's Magnet Accessory for Metal Doors Be Used with SwitchBot Lock Ultra (Only for Japan)？

No, we don't recommend using Lock Pro's magnet with Lock Ultra. Since Ultra has double the torque, using the Pro's magnet during emergency release might cause the lock body to shift. 
A dedicated magnet accessory for Lock Ultra will be available soon, stay tuned!

### Can Two SwitchBot Lock Ultra Devices Be Set up for Dual Lock?

Only the US and JP versions of Lock Ultra can be paired to create a dual lock. 
The EU version does not support this feature, but you can switch it to the US version in the settings page to enable dual lock functionality:
SwitchBot App -> Lock Ultra -> Gear Icon -> Basic Settings -> Door Lock Type
Please note: The EU version of Lock Ultra with night latch feature does not support dual lock.

### Does SwitchBot Lock Ultra Support Apple Home Key?

We regret to inform you that our Lock products (Lock, Lock Pro, and Lock Ultra) do not support Apple Home Key.
If you purchase Keypad Vision, you can activate transportation cards like Suica or PASMO (common in Japan*) on the Wallet app. Then, add these NFC cards to our keypad for a similar unlocking experience as with Home Key.
*Note:
We apologize that SwitchBot Lab currently does not have card data for European and American FeliCa cards. Please try adding your FeliCa card to confirm if it is supported.

### Is It Possible to Install SwitchBot Lock on a Steel Door?

Yes, SwitchBot Lock (including Lock Pro and Lock Ultra) can be installed on metal doors. However, since the lock uses a magnetic sensor, the door's metal material may occasionally interfere with the auto-lock function.
If this occurs, try repositioning the magnet 10-20mm farther than the default distance. For example:
Default spacing: 20mm from the Lock
Adjusted spacing: 30~40mm from the lock
This adjustment often resolves detection issues while maintaining reliability.

### Can I Use Screws to Secure SwitchBot Lock Ultra on the Door?

Yes, you can securely mount the Lock Ultra with screws, though they aren't included in the package. You'll need to purchase them separately:

1. To attach the Lock Ultra to the door with screws, use three KA2*6mm screws.

2. When using the height adjustment spacer (as shown below) for Lock Ultra, fix the height adjustment case to the door with two KA3*8mm screws.
