### Is It Possible to Install SwitchBot Lock on a Steel Door?

Yes, SwitchBot Lock (including Lock Pro and Lock Ultra) can be installed on metal doors. However, since the lock uses a magnetic sensor, the door's metal material may occasionally interfere with the auto-lock function.
If this occurs, try repositioning the magnet 10-20mm farther than the default distance. For example:
Default spacing: 20mm from the Lock
Adjusted spacing: 30~40mm from the lock
This adjustment often resolves detection issues while maintaining reliability.

### Can I Use Screws to Secure SwitchBot Lock Ultra on the Door?

Yes, you can securely mount the Lock Ultra with screws, though they aren't included in the package. You'll need to purchase them separately:

1. To attach the Lock Ultra to the door with screws, use three KA2*6mm screws.

2. When using the height adjustment spacer (as shown below) for Lock Ultra, fix the height adjustment case to the door with two KA3*8mm screws.

### Troubleshooting After Installing SwitchBot Lock Ultra on MIWA 75PM, There Is No Gap Between the Doorknob and the Lock, Making It Impossible to Turn the Doorknob.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
After reviewing your situation, we would like to explain that when any SwitchBot Lock product (including Lock Ultra) is installed on MIWA 75PM-style round knobs, due to the physical design of both the lock and the knob, the Lock unit may end up positioned very closely to the knob itself. As a result, it might be difficult to grip and turn the knob comfortably with your fingers as you normally would.
Following confirmation with our R&D team, one option you could try is using an auxiliary lever attachment, like the one shown below to see whether it improves operability for your setup:

### Troubleshooting I Unlocked the Door with a Key, but SwitchBot App Still Shows It as Locked, Causing Auto-Lock not to trigger

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
