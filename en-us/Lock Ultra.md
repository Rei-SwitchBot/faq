Lock Ultra, Lock Pro, and Lock are different versions of the product, they are not compatible and cannot be used as a dual-lock.

### Can Lock/Lock Pro's Magnet Accessory for Metal Doors Be Used with SwitchBot Lock Ultra (Only for Japan)ï¼Ÿ

No, we don't recommend using Lock Pro's magnet with Lock Ultra. Since Ultra has double the torque, using the Pro's magnet during emergency release might cause the lock body to shift. 
A dedicated magnet accessory for Lock Ultra will be available soon, stay tuned!

### Can Two SwitchBot Lock Ultra Devices Be Set up for Dual Lock?

Only the US and JP versions of Lock Ultra can be paired to create a dual lock. 
The EU version does not support this feature, but you can switch it to the US version in the settings page to enable dual lock functionality:
SwitchBot App -> Lock Ultra -> Gear Icon -> Basic Settings -> Door Lock Type
Please note: The EU version of Lock Ultra with night latch feature does not support dual lock.
