### Can I Combine Lock Ultra and Lock to Create a Dual-Lock (Only for Japan)?

Lock Ultra, Lock Pro, and Lock are different versions of the product, they are not compatible and cannot be used as a dual-lock.

### Can Lock/Lock Pro's Magnet Accessory for Metal Doors Be Used with SwitchBot Lock Ultra (Only for Japan)ï¼Ÿ

No, we don't recommend using Lock Pro's magnet with Lock Ultra. Since Ultra has double the torque, using the Pro's magnet during emergency release might cause the lock body to shift. 
A dedicated magnet accessory for Lock Ultra will be available soon, stay tuned!
