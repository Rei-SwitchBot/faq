### About the Cloud Storage Service on Indoor Cam

There are two options for the SwitchBot Indoor Cam to the storge recording date. One is by implementing a micro SD card, and the other is via the Cloud Storage Service. Here are some rules that we need to pay attention to when using the Cloud Storage Service.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/4408605821975/mceclip0.png)

1- By subscribing to the Cloud Storage Service or redeeming on the App, it will be activated from the day we proceed. The payment is only required once for each package. The service can be recovered during the valid period no matter how many times we disconnect the Indoor Cam from our SwitchBot account.

2- Once the Indoor Cam is disconnected from the SwitchBot account, the auto-renewing subscription will be suspended. We need to re-subscribe to the Cloud Storage Service by ourselves when it is expired.

3- One SwitchBot Indoor Cam can only subscribe to the Cloud Storage Service once at a time. If an Indoor Cam has already subscribed to the Cloud Storage Service, there will not be a subscription button on the purchasing page.

4- When the Cloud Storage Service is about to expire, a message will be sent on the notifications page of the APP 24 hours in advance. A second message will be sent when it almost hits the expiration date. Please noted that this message is not editable.

5- For new subscribers, we will offer an extra 30 days of use. Unsubscribing to the Service will not affect the extra 30 days of use.

Here are some Q&A to make know more about the rule of the Indoor Cam.

Q: Can I transfer the Cloud Storage Service subscription to another account?

A: If two SwitchBot accounts are created from the same region, the subscription can be transferred. If two accounts are created from different regions (e.g. one from the US and the other from the UK), the subscription cannot be transferred.

Q: What kind of storage plan can we choose for the Cloud Storage Service? Does it support self-configuration?

A: Currently, there are two kinds of storage plans. One is 7-day event recording, which will record the past 7 days of the event detected by the Indoor Cam while the other is 30-day event recording, which will record the past 30 days of the event under the same rules. Users can choose to pay for the subscription monthly or annually. All video cloud storage plans are configured in a unified manner. Self-configuration is not available for users.

Q: What services does the Cloud Storage Service provide?

A: The Cloud Storage Service consists of video life cycle, video uploading mechanism, and service validity period.

The video life cycle

refers to how long a video uploaded to the cloud can remain in the cloud. If the video life cycle is 7 days, the cloud will retain the data sent by the device in the past 7 days. On the 8th day, the cloud will automatically clear the data of the first day and upload the latest data, and so on. During the validity period of the service, users can view the videos of the past 7 days (excluding the situation that there is no data in the cloud when the service is just purchased, data cannot be uploaded when the device is offline, and data cannot be uploaded when the device is damaged).

The video upload mechanism

refers to the rules that the device uses to determine when to upload the video to the cloud. The current video recording mechanism is that when the device detects a motion in the video picture, the video is uploaded to the cloud, and all the video with actual events will be recorded.

The service validity period

refers to how long the service will last after the user purchases it. When the user places an order and pays successfully, the service will start timing. During the service validity period, the device will upload video data to the cloud under normal working conditions. When the service expires, the device stops uploading new video data to the cloud center. The uploaded video data will be deleted day by day according to the video life cycle rules specified in the service.

Let's take the 7-day monthly event storage plan as an example. The video life cycle for it would be 7 days, the video upload mechanism is event detection and the service validity period would be one month.

Q: It is safe that users upload their videos to the cloud system?

A: The Cloud Storage Service uses the AES128 algorithm to encrypt the video data and the dynamic secret key is used in the encryption process. The transmission process of data upload also uses a financial level secure TLS encryption channel. In the case of double encryption of data and channel, data cannot be intercepted during transmission, and video data cannot be played without the password to the user's account, ensuring the absolute security of user data. The Cloud Storage Services use dual encryption of data and channels, which complies with privacy regulations such as the GDPR.

Q: What is the default storage stream for video cloud storage?

A: It is consistent with the main code stream storage of memory card recording. The App interface cannot be modified.

Q: Is there a speed limit for uploading the videos to the cloud after the cloud storage service is enabled?

A: There is no upload speed limit, but there is a limit on the camera's bit rate, which is 1.5Mbps.

Q: How can I access the videos that have been saved after the subscription to the Cloud Storage Service is expired?

A: After the service expires, the device stops uploading new video data to the cloud. The uploaded video data will be deleted day by day according to the video life cycle rules specified in the service.

For example, if a user subscribes to a 7-day monthly event storage plan for his Indoor Cam on January 1, 2021, the device will continue to upload video data as long as it stays online and connected to his account before January 31, 2021. All the videos are saved for 7 days. Users will be able to view footage from 3rd January 12 pm to 10 January 12 pm at 12 pm on 10 January. When the service expires but the user does not renew the subscription in time, the device will no longer upload videos to the cloud, but users will still be able to view some of the video content uploaded by the device before the service expires until 7 February 2020.

Q: How do I extend my Cloud Storage Service purchased on the App?

A: The Cloud Storage Service does not support service refund and change of payment plan. You need to replace the service after the current service ends.

Q: Why can't I see the Cloud Storage Service I purchased after I changed my phone?

A: First, please make sure that the same SwitchBot account is logged in on your new phone.

Second, please be aware that the Cloud Storage Service is specific to both the account and the device. If the Indoor Cam that has subscribed to the Video Cloud Storage service has been disconnected and reconnected to a new account after the reset, the new account will need to purchase the service again if you want to use the Cloud Storage Service.

Q: If the Indoor Cam is shifted to a new account, can we see the historical cloud storage videos?

A: Newly bounded account cannot view previously stored video in the cloud. If user wants to use the Cloud Storage Service in the new account, he needs to make a new subscription to the service because the service is not transferrable.

### Can Indoor Cam be controlled only through the LAN?

Indoor Cam can not be controlled through the LAN. Most of the functions for the Indoor Cam are rely on cloud servers.



---
### Can my privacy be guaranteed if I use the service of cloud storage for videos?

The service of cloud storage for videos encrypts video data and uses financial service encryption technologies for data transmission and dynamic keys during encryption. As both the data and transmission channel are encrypted, hackers cannot play videos even if they intercept the videos. Similarly, the video stored in the SD card is also encrypted. You must log in to the App to view the video stored on the SD card. As a result, even if the SD card is stolen, others cannot view the video on your SD card.

### How to download/export the video stored in the Indoor Cam?

For security reasons, neither the video in the cloud storage nor the video in the SD card can be viewed by means other than the App:

The video cloud storage service encrypts the video data itself. At the same time, the data upload transmission process also uses financial-grade encryption technology, and the encryption process can use a dynamic key. In the case of double encryption of data and channels, even if user data is intercepted by hackers, the video cannot be played. To browse the encrypted videos in cloud storage, you must log in to your account on the App.

Even the videos saved in SD cards are mostly encrypted and cannot be transferred to a computer. If you want to browse encrypted videos in SD cards, you must Log in to your account on the App.

However, you can use the recording function in the App to record a part of the videos in play back.

### Use a microSD Card on the Indoor Cam

Updated: 2023.03.16

Applicable products:

Indoor Cam

SwitchBot app version:

6.24 or newer

Device firmware version:

1.1.3

Note: It's not recommend connecting the SwitchBot Indoor Cam to a hotspot because the Indoor Cam will transfer the videos, voice, and screenshots via the Internet. It may cause more than

5 Gigabytes per day

under HD monitoring.

When using a microSD card on Indoor Cam, pay attention to the following points:

SwitchBot Indoor Cam supports a MicroSD card, the capacity of which can be up to

128GB

.

The micro SD card should be in

FAT32 format

.

If we are using a micro SD card in other formats such as exFAT, we can format the card to

FAT32 format

on the computer before use.

There are two options for the Indoor Cam to record, one is event-only, and the other is continuous recording.

If we choose continuous recording, we need to make sure the SD card has enough capacity to do the job.

Normally, if the continuous recording mode is turned on and the definition is on HD 1080P, different capacities of the micro SD card can record in different duration.

For a 32GB micro SD card, the record can last for 3 days.

For a 64GB micro SD card, the record can last for 6 days.

For a 128GB micro SD card, the record can last for 12 days.

### What Is the Private Mode on Indoor Cam

Note:

We do not recommend connecting the SwitchBot Indoor Cam to a hotspot because the Indoor Cam will transfer the videos, voice, and screenshots via the Internet. It may cause more than

5 Gigabytes per day

under HD monitoring.

The SwitchBot Indoor Cam monitors our home 24/7 and alerts us when unexpected conditions take place. But in some circumstances like when we are back home or else, we don't need the camera to keep rolling and recording every movement of us in the house, then is when the

Private Mode

comes into play.

We can simply turn on the Private Mode on the control panel, or go to the settings page to turn it on.

### What Should We Do If The Indoor Cam Doesn't Receive Any Alarm Messages

Note:

We do not recommend connecting the SwitchBot Indoor Cam to a hotspot because the Indoor Cam will transfer the videos, voice, and screenshots via the Internet. It may cause more than

5 Gigabytes per day

under HD monitoring.

One of the functions of the Indoor Cam is, when motions are detected in front of the camera, a relevant alarm message will be sent to our cell phone. In that way, we can get a hold of what had happened during a specific time of a day in our room, or in the living, etc.

If we can't receive any alarm messages from the Indoor Cam, here are the things we should check before we can bring it back to work.

1. Make sure the network is stable on our cellphone

2. Make sure the Motion Detection is enabled

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25996928022423)

We can also set the sensitivity of the motion detection to high.

3. Make sure the notification on the SwitchBot App has been enabled

### What should I do if the device is offline after changing or resetting the router or changing the network provider?

Dear user, we are sorry for your inconvenience. Network configurations change if you replace the router or use a new network. To use a device that has been connected to a different network, first remove that device, reconnect it to the new network, and then add it again. You need to reconnect all the Wi-Fi devices and gateways. If your device fails to connect to the smart device after replacing the router or modem, it may be that your router is 2.4GHz and 5Ghz mixed, or your router is not compatible with our device.

Note: Even you change back the SSID and Wi-Fi password to the same as the original one, you still need to select the network and Wi-Fi password again when readd your devices. If you not, there may be a problem of not being able to connect to the Internet. This is because the Wi-Fi password you set in the router will be encrypted by the router into a string of longer and more complex passwords to prevent others from cracking and stealing. After you reset the router or replace the router, even if you set the same password, it will be encrypted by the router into a new password. If you do not re-select the network and enter the password when configuring the network, the router will still receive the previously encrypted password, so the connection will time out.

### Will my video data on the cloud be deleted after the cloud storage service expires?

When your service package expires and you do not renew it, your device stops uploading video data to the cloud and your video data will be deleted from the cloud day by day based on the lifecycles defined in your service package. You can purchase cloud storage services based on your requirements.

For example, if you purchase a 30-day event package, the cloud stores your videos from the latest 30 days and deletes the videos that have been stored for longer than 30 days, such as deleting the first-day data on 31.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Indoor Cam Feels Too High When Touched.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The camera's surface may feel warmer than room temperature during normal use because its internal electronic components are operating. This is a common characteristic of electric devices, similar to how a smartphone generates heat after extended use. Particularly, our cameras are designed to operate continuously for 24 hours, so a certain amount of heat generation due to constant power supply is considered normal.
However, if the heat level is noticeably increasing or the surface becomes too hot to touch, it could indicate the possibility of aging or other issues. To better understand the situation, we would appreciate it if you could provide the following details:
- The current room temperature  
- A warmth that is either comfortable to the touch or hot enough to feel upon contact
- If possible, the measured surface temperature of the camera
