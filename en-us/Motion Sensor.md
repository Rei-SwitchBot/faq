### I create a Scene triggered by Motion Sensor but why it did not work when I go into the Motion Detection area?

Product: SwitchBot Motion Sensor, SwitchBot Contact Sensor

SwitchBot App software version: 6.10 or newer

Make sure the SwitchBot App is up to date.

Check the Logs of the SwitchBot Motion Sensor and see if there is any recorded motion detection.

1. If there is no relevant motion detection, it might be the fact that the temperature of the environment is close to our body temperature, making the Motion Sensor fail to detect motion based on temperature discrepancy. In that case, please try to lower the temperature of the environment.

Note: The smaller the difference between our body temperature and the environment temperature, the lower the Motion Sensor's sensitivity will be.

2. If there is relevant motion detection on the Logs, the problem might go to the Scene settings. Please check if other conditions in the Scene are met or not.

### Motion Sensor and Contact Sensor detection frequency.

For those of you wondering how SwitchBot Motion Sensor and SwitchBot Contact Sensor recognize motion, you can check a brief explanation below:

Recognizing motion detection.

When a user enters the detection area that was previously in a

No Motion Detected

state, motion sensor will recognize such motion. Any scene or automation that triggers

Motion Detected

will be triggered and executed immediately.

Recognizing no motion.

In order to prevent malfunctions, false alarms, and false detections, when a user leaves your device's detection area, your motion sensor will not immediately recognize

No Motion Detected

. When no moving object is detected for 30 seconds, your motion sensor will judge and recognize that no motion is detected. In short, in order to satisfy such a condition, it would be necessary to detect a moving object first and then stop detecting the moving object for a certain period of time. Any scene or automation that triggers this clause (No Motion Detected) will then be triggered.

For Example:

Motion sensor:

No Motion Detected

at 13:00:00

User: Entering the detection area recognized as

No Motion Detected

at 13:01:00

Motion sensor: Recognizes

Motion Detected

at 13:01:00

User: Leaving detection area at 13:05:00

Motion sensor: 13:05:30 recognizes

No Motion Detected

### Position for Installing Motion Sensor

Please install the Motion Sensor as the picture shows.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998165151127)

※The best working temperature for the Motion Sensor is 25℃.

If you would not like the motion sensor to detect the motions of your pets, you may need to place the motion sensor upside down. And the motion sensor should be placed taller than the pets about 0.1-0.2 meters.

### The detection status of the device shown by the app is different from the actual status.

If the device detection status indicated by the app is different from the actual status, please check the device Log.

1. If the history shows the actual status of the device.

The detection function of the device runs normally. The network connection may be unstable and there may be a delay in updating the status in the app. Please check your network environment.

2. If there is no log of the actual state of the device in the history.

If the device was added successfully, but there is no log of status change or execution in the device Log, the device may be defective.

### Why do my devices be triggered by Motion Sensor constantly?

If we create a Scene to trigger SwitchBot devices by Motion Sensor, they will be triggered as long as the conditions are met. If the conditions are met constantly in a short period of time, the corresponding SwitchBot device will be triggered frequently.

In order to make the trigger more accurate according to our desire, we can set multiple conditions in one Scene. For example, we can make the Scene be valid at a certain period of time during a day.
