### Can I calibrate my SwitchBot Outdoor Meter? How?

Last Updated: 2023 May 17

Related Products: SwitchBot Outdoor Meter

The short answer is "yes," but we have a range of tips to help make sure this goes smoothly.

First, you will need an accurate reference for temperature and/or humidity. Each value is calibrated separately, and you can choose to calibrate one, both, or neither as necessary. The accuracy of the uncalibrated Meter can be found in the manual.

Calibration is only intended to correct for small variations (typically up to a few degrees or around 5% relative humidity).

WITH A REFERENCE DEVICE

If you have a trusted thermometer or hygrometer that you know to be very accurate, you can use it as a reference. Simply place it next to the SwitchBot Meter in a stable environment, let them sit for at least 30 minutes to acclimate to each other, be sure you have an updated reading, and then use the calibration controls (shown below) to adjust the SwitchBot Meter to match the reference.

To access the Meter settings, tap the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Meter you want to control on the SwitchBot App homepage. Then click "Calibration."

TEMPERATURE

If you don't have a reference device, you can still calibrate your Meter. Ice water makes a great temperature reference. Just mix up a bowl of ice water with a good even mixture of ice and water. Give it a good stir and let it sit while you seal your SwitchBot Meter in a zip-top baggie. Get as much air out of the bag as possible. Place the SwitchBot Meter (inside the baggie) into the ice water mixture. It's better to leave the zip-top out of the water, just in case it doesn't seal entirely.

Give the SwitchBot Meter at least 30 minutes to acclimate, be sure you have an updated reading, and then adjust the calibration controls so the value reads exactly 32.0°F (0.0°C)

If you have any difficulties, consider these tips:

First, make sure that when you run the test, you have removed as much air from the bag as possible.

Second, make sure that the screen side of the Meter is facing the water.

Third, make sure the Meter is submerged in the ice water as much as possible, for the reason that the plastic case, the battery, and the other components need to be brought to equilibrium.

HUMIDITY

For calibrating humidity, the "salt test" is quite popular, and instructions can be found readily on the Internet. The chemical principle is sound and it can work quite well, but we find it to be difficult to execute consistently and accurately.

Calibrating to an inaccurate reference can be worse than not calibrating at all, so we prefer the Boveda One-Step Hygrometer Calibration Kit, available for less than $10 on Amazon.

Just open the baggie, seal your SwitchBot Meter inside, and place it at room temperature in a location with minimal temperature variations. Let it sit undisturbed for at least 24-36 hours, be sure you have an updated reading, and then adjust the calibration controls to read exactly 75.0% humidity. Keep the calibration kit sealed, and you can use it multiple times for at least three months after the initial test.

### The Information About SwitchBot Outdoor Meter Battery

Last Updated: 2024 Feb 20

Related Products: SwitchBot Outdoor Meter

1. You'll find 2 AAA batteries inside the SwitchBot Outdoor Meter, which can be used for approximately 1 year (Panasonic batteries are recommended). The SwitchBot Outdoor Meter can measure temperatures as low as -20°C. However, using it in extreme environments will reduce the battery life and may also affect the accuracy of temperature and humidity measurements.Depending on the temperature and the frequency of data readings, service life may also be shortened.

2. When replacing batteries, open the lid on the lower backside of the main unit, remove the used batteries, and insert new batteries in the correct direction (+) (-).

3. Ni-MH rechargeable batteries can be used, but make sure the output voltage is between 2.2V and 3.6V.

4. In general, we recommend using batteries at an ambient temperature of 5°C to 45°C. If the temperature is lower than the specified temperature, the batteries may not be able to operate properly. On the other hand, if the batteries are used at high temperatures, they may easily deteriorate and leak. In any case, please refrain from using the batteries as they will have a bad influence on SwitchBot Outdoor Meter itself.

※

Please Note:

We recommend removing batteries should you not need to use your device for a long period of time.

### How to Access SwitchBot Outdoor Meter Temperature and Humidity Data Recorded During Outdoor Use

Related Products: SwitchBot Outdoor Meter
Precondition

Normally, I use my Outdoor Meter connected to a Hub at home, syncing all the data to the cloud. One day, I took it out with me, and when I got back, I realized I couldn’t view the data recorded while I was away. Why does this happen?

Reason

Starting from SwitchBot App V9.0, the "Cloud Service" option was removed from the settings. Instead, when you tap on the Outdoor Meter in the app, a “Store Data to Cloud” button now appears at the bottom of the graph screen. Tapping this button enables the cloud storage of temperature and humidity data, functioning the same as activating the previous "Cloud Service" option.

However, data recorded via Bluetooth and data saved to the cloud are stored through separate processes and do not merge. Once you enable the “Store Data to Cloud” feature, the app will prioritize displaying data stored in the cloud. As a result, data recorded via Bluetooth while away from the Hub will no longer appear on the graph screen.

Solution

If you often take the Outdoor Meter away from home, here are some tips to ensure you can access all your data:

1. Do not tap the “Store Data to Cloud” button to avoid saving data to the cloud.

2. Consider purchasing a  second Outdoor Meter to use exclusively when on the go.

3. If you’ve already enabled the “Store Data to Cloud” feature and want to view Bluetooth data recorded while away, try below:

SwitchBot App≤9.5

You can remove the device from the app and re-add it to access the data recorded while away. However, if the device remains connected to the Hub (meaning you have enabled the “Store Data to Cloud” feature again), you’ll need to repeat this process of removing and re-adding it each time you take it out.

SwitchBot App≥V9.6 (will be released in January):

Create a new home in the app without a Hub.
Temporarily move the Outdoor Meter to this home and connect via Bluetooth to read the data. Also export the data if needed.
Move the Outdoor Meter back to your original home with the Hub when finished.
Repeat this process each time you take the device outside.
Note:

The Outdoor Meter can store up to 68 days of data locally when connected via Bluetooth. After this, older data will be overwritten. To prevent data loss, ensure you load and export the data in time.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Outdoor Meter’s Temperature and Humidity Don’t Appear in Alexa Routines

We apologize for any inconvenience our product caused.
SwitchBot Outdoor Meter is recognized as a temperature and humidity sensor in the Alexa app. However, Alexa does not yet support using temperature and humidity data as triggers for routines. As a result, you won’t see Outdoor Meter’s temperature or humidity as available conditions when creating Alexa Routines.
As an alternative, consider using SwitchBot, SmartThings, IFTTT or Apple Home apps. These platforms support setting temperature and humidity data, including readings from the Outdoor Meter, as triggers for automation. This can help you create more customized routines based on environmental conditions.
If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us.
