### Why Is There Still a Weak Current in SwitchBot Plug Mini EU After Turning off Power?

After the Plug Mini EU power is turned off, the device will not shut down completely but will enter standby mode, maintaining a weak electric current. In this mode, the Plug Mini EU acts as a lightweigh gateway for remote confirmation and control of SwitchBot Bluetooth devices connected to it. If you disconnect power supply completely (e.g., during a power outage), the gateway function of the Plug Mini EU will be disabled, preventing remote control of Bluetooth devices through the SwitchBot app.
We are sorry for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding.
