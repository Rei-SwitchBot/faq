### What to Do If My Floor Cleaning Robot Won’t Enter Dark Rug Areas?

Last Updated：

2024 Oct 09

Related Products: SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10

SwitchBot App Version: 8.8 or newer

Firmware Version: 1.0.760 or newer

The S10 is equipped with highly sensitive cliff sensors designed to ensure your robot’s safety by preventing falls. These sensors are so precise that they may occasionally recognize dark-colored carpets as a drop, triggering the fall-prevention function and causing the robot to stop working on those areas.

While we work on a permanent solution, we can offer a temporary workaround to help maintain uninterrupted cleaning.

You can use the SwitchBot App to mark the dark carpet areas, allowing the S10 to continue cleaning those zones without interruption. Here’s how you can set it up:

Open the SwitchBot App.

Tap your S10 robot.

Tap the map icon in the center-left of the screen.

Go to "Edit Floor".

Select "Carpet Cleaning" and then "Carpet Settings".

Mark the areas with dark-colored carpets.

Important Note:

When you mark dark-colored areas for cleaning, the cliff sensor sensitivity will decrease.

If you have staircases or other potential hazards nearby, we recommend setting those areas as "No-Go Zones" instead of marking them as dark carpet areas to prevent accidents.

If you have any questions, please contact us via SwitchBot App > Profile > Help & Feedback >Feedback.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot Won’t Enter Dark Carpet Areas

The S10 is equipped with highly sensitive cliff sensors designed to ensure your robot’s safety by preventing falls. These sensors are so precise that they may occasionally recognize dark-colored carpets as a drop, triggering the fall-prevention function and causing the robot to stop working on those areas. While we work on a permanent solution, we can offer a temporary workaround to help maintain uninterrupted cleaning.
You can use the SwitchBot App to mark the dark carpet areas, allowing the S10 to continue cleaning those zones without interruption. Here’s how you can set it up:
- Open the SwitchBot App.
- Tap your S10 robot.
- Tap the map icon in the center-left of the screen.
- Go to "Edit Floor".
- Select "Carpet Cleaning" and then "Carpet Settings".
- Mark the areas with dark-colored carpets.
Important Note:
When you mark dark-colored areas for cleaning, the cliff sensor sensitivity will decrease. If you have staircases or other potential hazards nearby, we recommend setting those areas as "No-Go Zones" instead of marking them as dark carpet areas to prevent accidents.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding as we work towards a permanent solution. If you need further assistance or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Is Draining Battery Quickly

Please check the following points regarding the battery consumption of your Floor Cleaning Robot S10:
1. When cleaning carpets, the robot automatically operates at maximum suction power by default, which may result in faster battery consumption than usual.
2. Cleaning in "Max" mode consumes battery power more quickly compared to other modes.
3. If the mop washing and dust collection frequencies are set, the robot will frequently return to the station during cleaning. This can lower cleaning efficiency and lead to higher power consumption than normal.
4. If none of the above applies to your situation, please contact us via SwitchBot App -> Profile -> Support ->Feedback. Our R&D team will investigate the issue. If possible, please provide a screenshot showing a sudden drop in battery level within a short period.
