### What to Do If My Floor Cleaning Robot Won’t Enter Dark Rug Areas?

Last Updated：

2024 Oct 09

Related Products: SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10

SwitchBot App Version: 8.8 or newer

Firmware Version: 1.0.760 or newer

The S10 is equipped with highly sensitive cliff sensors designed to ensure your robot’s safety by preventing falls. These sensors are so precise that they may occasionally recognize dark-colored carpets as a drop, triggering the fall-prevention function and causing the robot to stop working on those areas.

While we work on a permanent solution, we can offer a temporary workaround to help maintain uninterrupted cleaning.

You can use the SwitchBot App to mark the dark carpet areas, allowing the S10 to continue cleaning those zones without interruption. Here’s how you can set it up:

Open the SwitchBot App.

Tap your S10 robot.

Tap the map icon in the center-left of the screen.

Go to "Edit Floor".

Select "Carpet Cleaning" and then "Carpet Settings".

Mark the areas with dark-colored carpets.

Important Note:

When you mark dark-colored areas for cleaning, the cliff sensor sensitivity will decrease.

If you have staircases or other potential hazards nearby, we recommend setting those areas as "No-Go Zones" instead of marking them as dark carpet areas to prevent accidents.

If you have any questions, please contact us via SwitchBot App > Profile > Help & Feedback >Feedback.

### Daylight Saving Time with SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10

Currently, the schedule and "Do Not Disturb" times set for SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 are stored locally, meaning they don’t automatically adjust with Daylight Saving Time changes.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot Won’t Enter Dark Carpet Areas

The S10 is equipped with highly sensitive cliff sensors designed to ensure your robot’s safety by preventing falls. These sensors are so precise that they may occasionally recognize dark-colored carpets as a drop, triggering the fall-prevention function and causing the robot to stop working on those areas. While we work on a permanent solution, we can offer a temporary workaround to help maintain uninterrupted cleaning.
You can use the SwitchBot App to mark the dark carpet areas, allowing the S10 to continue cleaning those zones without interruption. Here’s how you can set it up:
- Open the SwitchBot App.
- Tap your S10 robot.
- Tap the map icon in the center-left of the screen.
- Go to "Edit Floor".
- Select "Carpet Cleaning" and then "Carpet Settings".
- Mark the areas with dark-colored carpets.
Important Note:
When you mark dark-colored areas for cleaning, the cliff sensor sensitivity will decrease. If you have staircases or other potential hazards nearby, we recommend setting those areas as "No-Go Zones" instead of marking them as dark carpet areas to prevent accidents.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding as we work towards a permanent solution. If you need further assistance or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

---
### Does SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Support Matter?

Yes, the S10 supports Matter. You can sync it to either the Apple Home app or Google Home app as a secondary device through a Hub 2 or Hub Mini Matter. This lets you control cleaning and recharging from either app.
With firmware version 1.0.984 or later, the S10 works directly with Matter as a standalone device. This means you can add it straight to your Apple Home app to control mapping, start cleaning, and check standby status. Currently, room-specific cleaning isn't available as the S10 supports Matter 1.2 features, and we're working on adding Matter 1.4 support in future updates.
The Google Home app now supports the "robot vacuum cleaner" device type. Connect your Google Home hub and the S10 robot to the same 2.4 GHz network , then add it to the Google Home app using Matter. Also, since the S10 is compatible with Matter V1.2 specifications, some features may not be available yet. Thank you for your understanding.

### How Often Should I Replace the Dust Bag of the SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10?

The replacement frequency of the dust bag depends on your cleaning habits and environment. Below are estimates based on different usage scenarios:
For cleaning 5 times a week:
Assuming each cleaning collects 80g of debris:
80g × 5 times/week × 4 weeks = 1.6L of debris collected per month.
With a 4L dust bag, the estimated usage period is approximately 2.5 months (70 days).
For cleaning 4 times a week:
Under the same assumption:
80g × 4 times/week × 4 weeks = 1.28L of debris collected per month.
In this case, the dust bag is estimated to last about 3 months (90 days).
We recommend replacing the dust bag every 2 to 3 months depending on your actual usage and household environment.

---
### Will I Receive a Push Notification From Switchbot When the Dust Bag of the Switchbot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Is Full?

We regret to inform you that SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 currently does not have a push notification feature in the app to alert you when the dust bag is full. The dust bag has a capacity of 4 liters, and we recommend replacing it every 2 to 3 months, depending on your actual usage and household environment. 

---

### Why Does SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Make a Sound Every Ten Minutes While Drying the Roller Mop?

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The Floor Cleaning Robot S10 emits a sound every ten minutes while drying the mop. This is because the robot rotates the mop at regular intervals to achieve optimal drying. Please note that this is an intentional design feature and not a malfunction. You can safely continue using the product without any concerns.
If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us.

---
### About the Temperature of SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 When Drying Mop

When the S10 dries its mop, the core air outlet temperature is around 50°C (122°F), which is lower than the heat from a heated carpet or a hot air blower. This temperature is set within a safe range and is designed to prevent any damage to your flooring during normal use.

However, if you have particularly delicate flooring or are concerned about potential damage, we can provide you with an anti-moisture mat to offer extra protection for your floors.

We hope this information helps to ease any concerns. If you would like the anti-moisture mat or have any other questions, please feel free to contact us.

---
### Placement Guidelines for SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Water Station

1. Place the Water Station on a hard, level surface, with its back pressed against the wall or baseboard.
2. Make sure there is at least 1 meter of space in front of the Water Station, more than 15mm above, and at least 50mm on each side.
3. Avoid placing the Water Station on carpets or soft mats.
4. The Water Station is 10cm in height and can be placed under a cabinet depending on your needs.
5. Moving the Water Station during everyday use may prevent the Floor Cleaning Robot S10 from changing water properly. If the placement conditions restrict the back of the Water Station from having a support point, you can use the water pipe holder from the S10 Water Pipe Kit, or other tools, to secure the Water Station in place and prevent it from being easily moved.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a498da77-3bfb-4c90-b9dd-a37414a4262d)

6. If the Water Station moves left and right when placed against a wall, you can use two 3M adhesive strips to attach the back of the Water Station to the wall to prevent movement.

### Does the SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10's Water System Have a Temperature Limit for Water Input?

The acceptable temperature range for the water in the water system of the S10 is between 0°C and 40°C (32°F~104°F). However, we recommend using water within the temperature range of 5°C to 40°C (41°F~104°F).


---
### Can I Use Cleaning Solutions From Other Brands for SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10?

No. Non-SwitchBot cleaning solutions should not be used as they may cause corrosion to the S10's water station. If needed, please buy the official SwitchBot cleaning solution from our website.

---
### Can I Use Homemade Cleaning Solutions in the SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10?

No. Homemade cleaning solutions may cause corrosion to the water station of the S10, so please do not use DIY cleaning solutions. If necessary, we recommend purchasing the official SwitchBot original cleaning solution available on our official website.

---
### Can Hard Water Be Used in SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10?

SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 uses cold water directly from your household water supply and does not heat the water during operation. This means limescale buildup occurs at a slower rate. However, if your local water supply has high hardness, limescale may still form over time with regular use. We recommend checking your water hardness level and considering your usage frequency before deciding whether to use the S10 with hard water.

---
### Is It Possible to Purchase Just the Water Station for the SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10?

Currently, the water station for the S10 is not available for individual purchase. If there is an issue with the water station during the warranty period, we will arrange a replacement for you. For separate purchases, please contact customer support for assistance.

---
### Can the auto-refill function of SwitchBot Evaporative Humidifier (Auto-refill) be used when cleaning the floor with a cleaning solution using SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10?

Once SwitchBot Evaporative Humidifier (Auto-refill) is connected to the S10, you can use the S10 to automatically supply water to the humidifier.
Since the S10 main unit and the water station use the same water supply tube, do not use the Evaporative Humidifier's auto-refill function when the water station is filled with cleaning solution. A small amount of cleaning solution may stick to the water supply tube, and during humidifier operation, this cleaning solution could mix in and be released into the air.
If you have already added cleaning solution to the S10 water station, please disable the auto-add solution feature in the SwitchBot App. Then, vacuum and mop your floor once. You can use the auto-refill function safely after using all of the cleaning solutions mixed with clean water.
Way to disable the auto-add solution:
SwitchBot App -> Floor Cleaning Robot S10 -> Gear icon -> Maintenance -> disable the Auto-add Solution

### Troubleshooting Water Inside the Dustbin & Dust Bag of SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10, Causing Odor

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
The dust bag in the Floor Cleaning Robot S10 is made of non-woven material with moisture-resistant properties, but if the robot frequently picks up wet waste or high-moisture debris, mold and bacteria may grow inside, leading to unpleasant odors. In such cases, we recommend replacing the dust bag more frequently to prevent odor and bacterial buildup.
Additionally, the S10 does not support a mopping-only mode due to its unique roller design. If there is excessive water on the floor, the robot may struggle to handle it properly. If water enters the suction path, it can cause malfunctions, so we strongly advise against allowing the robot to pick up standing water.
If water has already entered the dustbin, dust bag, or auto-empty station, please follow these steps:
- Wash the dustbin and filter with clean water, then allow them to dry completely.
- Replace the dust bag with a new one.
- Wipe down the main brush frame, rubber brush, suction port of the auto-empty station, and the mop drying outlet with a dry cloth.
- If water has entered the internal components and the device is not functioning properly, please contact our support team for further assistance.
If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out. We're always happy to help!

### Troubleshooting Suction Power Drops After SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Runs at Max Power for Around 10 Minutes

We wanted to let you know that when the S10 operates in MAX mode for more than 10 minutes, it will automatically switch to Power mode.
This adjustment is designed to protect the fan’s lifespan and extend the battery life, as MAX mode consumes a significant amount of power quickly. Please rest assured that this is a standard feature of the product and not a malfunction.
We appreciate your understanding and apologize for any confusion this might cause. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out.

### Troubleshooting About Hair Getting Tangled on SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10’s Main Brush

Thank you for reaching out to us. We’re truly sorry if hair tangling on the main brush has caused you any inconvenience. We completely understand how frustrating this can be, and we appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.
The S10 uses a rubber brush, which is designed to reduce hair tangling compared to traditional bristle brushes. However, when there is a large amount of hair, it may still wrap around the ends of the brush. This is a common occurrence with robot vacuums, we recommend using the small cleaning tool included in the package to remove any hair buildup regularly.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Makes Sound While Operating

We sincerely apologize if the sound from your S10 has caused any inconvenience. We completely understand how important a quiet and comfortable home environment is, and we appreciate your feedback.
To ensure that the mop stays clean throughout the mopping process, the S10 is designed to automatically clean the mop while in use. This involves continuously spraying clean water, rotating the roller, and collecting dirty water. As a result, some sound is unavoidable. In particular, during the dirty water collection process, the waste water collection gutter presses against the roller to efficiently remove water, which creates slight resistance. This can cause the motor to run louder at times, but rest assured, this is a normal part of the cleaning process.
We are always working to improve our products based on customer feedback. Your insights are invaluable in helping us refine our technology, and we will continue to seek ways to make the S10 even quieter without compromising its cleaning performance. We truly appreciate your support and understanding!
If the noise from your robot seems different from what we’ve described, we would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with a video capturing the sound. This will allow us to investigate further and offer a suitable solution.

If you have already provided this information, our team will review it and follow up with you shortly. Thank you for your patience, and please let us know if you need further assistance.

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Catches on Rug Tassels or Drags Small Rugs

Thank you for reaching out to us, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by our product.
We understand that smaller rugs with tassels may sometimes get caught in the robot or be moved around during cleaning. To address this, we would like to suggest the following solutions:
For rugs with tassels:
We highly recommend setting the entire rug, including the tassels, as a "No-Go Zone" in the app.
*Please note that this will require manual cleaning of the rug area.
For smaller rugs without tassels:
You can use adhesive tape to secure the rug to the floor. This will prevent the robot from moving the rug while cleaning.

We deeply apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding as we work to improve our products. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

### Can I Wash SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10’s Roller Mop in a Washing Machine?

No, we do not recommend washing the S10’s roller mop in a washing machine.
The roller mop and its hard ABS plastic frame are designed as a single, non-detachable unit. Placing it in a washing machine could damage the rigid ABS structure due to high-speed spinning or collisions with other items. This may also harm your washing machine’s drum or nearby laundry.
For safe and effective cleaning:
- Remove the entire roller assembly from the robot.
- Hand-wash it in water with mild detergent. Let it soak briefly to loosen dirt.
- Rinse thoroughly and air-dry completely before reinstalling.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc9ecf91-72dc-4632-84d4-b987a686f728)

Regular manual cleaning preserves the mop’s performance and extends its lifespan. Replace the roller mop every 3 months, depending on usage frequency.

### Troubleshooting Suction Power Drops After SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Runs at Max Power for Around 10 Minutes

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
We wanted to let you know that when the S10 operates in MAX mode for more than 10 minutes, it will automatically switch to Power mode.
This adjustment is designed to protect the fan’s lifespan and extend the battery life, as MAX mode consumes a significant amount of power quickly. Please rest assured that this is a standard feature of the product and not a malfunction.
We appreciate your understanding and apologize for any confusion this might cause. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out.

### How Many SwitchBot Evaporative Humidifiers (Auto-refill) Can Be Paired With SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10?

### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Said It Would Wet the Mop Before Cleaning, but It Skipped That Step and Started Cleaning Instead. I’m Using the Custom Mode.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, we want to clarify how certain features work in different cleaning modes.
If you’ve selected Custom Mode and notice that the robot starts cleaning directly without going to the water station to dampen the mop or wash the mop, this is expected behavior. In Custom Mode, the dampen mop and wash mop functions are temporarily disabled as part of the current product design—this is not a malfunction.
For these features to work as intended, please switch to the standard Vac & Mop Mode. This will ensure the robot visits the water station to prepare the mop before cleaning.
We understand this may differ from your expectations, and we appreciate your patience as we continue to improve our products. If you have any further questions, our support team is happy to help.
Thank you for your understanding!

### Does SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10's Water Station Automatically Increase Water Pressure for Faster Drainage?

No, the water station does not have an automatic pressure-boosting function during drainage.
The water station is equipped with a built-in pump that directly draws wastewater from the robot's waste water tank and discharges it into your home's drainage pipe. While the drain hose can be installed with a maximum height difference of 2 meters, we recommend keeping it within 1 meter for the most reliable drainage performance.
Laboratory tests show that the drainage system maintains an end-point water pressure of 35kPa. As long as the height does not exceed 2 meters, no additional pressurization equipment is needed, the system will work properly under normal conditions.

---
### What Is the Maximum Height at Which SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 Sewage Pipe Can Be Installed?

The built-in pump drainage system in the S10 water station can drain water up to a maximum level of 2m. For optimal drainage, it is recommended that the installation location of the sewage pipe should not exceed a height of 1m. The R&D laboratory measured the water pressure at the end of the drain pipe to be 35kPa.
