Some customers do not want some of the new features included

Older models may not work properly with new firmware

Automatic updates may not work on older models

If you would like to request a new firmware version, please log in to our App, go to

Profile

->

### Difference Between Scene and Automation

Last Updated: 2023 Nov 24

SwitchBot App Version: V7.8.1 or newer

Scenes are manual Scenes from the previous version, and manual execution is the default condition. Once the Scene name and action are saved, the Scene can be executed by tapping the Scene name on the SwitchBot App home screen, or by voice control with Alexa or Google Assistant.

Automation is the older version of automated scenes. It is an interlocking function that sets a schedule, geofence function, or SwitchBot device as a condition, and when the condition is met, the SwitchBot device in the action will be executed.

### Geofencing (Beta) Feature

L

ast Updated：

2024 Jan 05

SwitchBot App Version: 7.10 or newer

1． The Geofencing(Beta) Feature utilizes a geofence—an area defined by virtual boundaries. This system employs GPS location data to ascertain when a user enters or exits the predetermined geo-fenced zone.

2． In the SwitchBot App, the Geofencing (Beta) feature is also referred to as "When I Arrive (Beta)" and ‘’When I Leave (Beta)".

3． "When I Arrive (Beta)" and "When I Leave (Beta)" can be set as conditions/preconditions for Automation. It is recommended to set the radius length to

at least 200 meters (0.2 KM)

when setting up.

*Related Posts：

[How to Create Automation](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/19569270617879)

4． We will guide you through Automation that makes use of the Geofencing (Beta) feature.

Automation 1

Name: I'm Home

When: When I arrive

Then: Turn on the air conditioner heating + turn on the lights

Automation 2

Name: Leaving Home

When: When I leave

Then: Turn off the air conditioner + turn off the lights

Automation 3

Name: TV On

When: Saturdays and Sundays at 8:00 AM

Add condition:

When I'm home

Then： Turn on the TV

Automation 4

Name: Close All SwitchBot Curtains

When: Sunset

Add condition:

When I'm not home

Then： Close all SwitchBot Curtains

5． The triggers for Automation set for "When I Arrive (Beta)" and "When I Leave (Beta)" features require the movement of the configured smartphone (inside the geofence to outside/ outside to inside). If you use multiple smartphones, the automation can only be triggered by the movement of the smartphone on which the automation was created. If needed, you can edit the automation again on the target smartphone to enable triggering.

6．

To use the "When I Arrive (Beta)" and "When I Leave (Beta)" features, you need to always allow access to the smartphone's location information (there may be a possibility of faster battery consumption). Also, please ensure that the Wi-Fi on your smartphone remains enabled in the settings at all times.

7． Automation set for

"When I Arrive (Beta)" and "When I Leave (Beta)" features

will not be triggered by the movements of home members. Only the movements of the owner are considered.

8． At the moment,

the "When I Arrive (Beta)" and "When I Leave (Beta)" features are

available as a beta version and may have some instability in their operation. Please understand this.

9． If you have any questions, please contact us via SwitchBot App > Profile > Help & Feedback >Feedback.

### Identity Verification

Last Updated: 2024 Aug 29

Whenever you attempt to change your email address, password, or modify anything that concerns your account security, we will send an email to you to verify your identity.

It is essential you sign up your account using a valid email for future verification.

I can sign in to my email but I don't seem to receive any verification email.

Please view this article,

[Failed to get verification code from SwitchBot?](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038192793)

I cannot sign in to my email account.

Please understand that it is your responsibility to ensure access to your own email account so that we can verify your SwitchBot account through sending you verification code. Otherwise, we are unable to verify your identity as the owner of a particular account securely.

As a final attempt, we kindly ask you to try open the browser of your PC or any personal device that you have a mail app installed on. You may find some luck in other frequently logged in devices.

### Incompatible Wi-Fi Network or Deprecated Wi-Fi network

Most home Wi-Fi networks are compatible with SwitchBot products. However, there are a few networks that are not recommended.

Deprecated Wi-Fi network

Mobile access points: May cause issue with bandwidth, availability, data caps, and usage fees; SwitchBot products work best with an always-on, stable Internet connection, so you should always leave your mobile access point device at home. If your SwitchBot product is not continuously connected to the Internet, you will not be able to check its status or receive notifications on your smartphone.

Public or open network: Anyone can connect to it, which poses a security risk. For security reasons, do not connect your SwitchBot product to a network whose details you do not know. Also, do not use a network owned by another user without their permission.

Guest networks: These are owned by other users and can cause problems even if you have permission from the owner. For example, you may not be able to troubleshoot Wi-Fi or Internet problems because you do not have access to the router's settings.

Incompatible Wi-Fi Networks

Captive portal networks: SwitchBot products are not compatible with captive portal networks commonly used in airports, hotels, schools, Internet cafes, and coffee shops. These networks require you to log in to a web page, and in some cases, agree to terms of service before connecting.

Enterprise Networks: Enterprise networks, such as 802.1x / RADIUS networks, are not compatible with SwitchBot products.

5 GHz networks: Not available for all products; SwitchBot products are only compatible with 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi networks.



---
### Initial Device Name of SwitchBot

When registering a device, the default device name is followed by a two-digit number or romaji (eg:

Hubmini A1

). Why is it different from the number on the product package or product image? Old model? fake?

The number is not the model number of the device, but the last two digits of the device's BLE MAC. BLE MAC has a different number for each device (the last two digits may be the same number).

SwitchBot App Version: V7.8.1 or newer

1. Scene 3.0 allows you to put a timer between multiple actions. Please be aware it may be unstable in operation because it is a beta version at this time.

2. Timer execution can be added to actions for both Scenes and Automation.

3. A timer can be set for up to 59 minutes and 59 seconds.

4. If you wish to set more than 59 minutes and 59 seconds for a timer run, you may add multiple timer runs.

5. Up to ten timer runs can be added to an action.

6. Let's take a typical winter day as an example.

At the end of a regular workday, before arriving home, the air conditioner is turned on to heat the house.

Half an hour later, when you arrive home, the light comes on.

Almost two hours later, the air conditioner turns off.

### Notes on SwitchBot App V8.6 Update

Last Updated: 2024 Jul 25

Related Products: SwitchBot App

SwitchBot App Version: 8.6 or newer

An important update regarding SwitchBot App, specifically for our Android users.

With the recent release of SwitchBot App Version 8.6, Android users must enable location permissions to use the App's Bluetooth functionality, including adding and controlling BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices.

This requirement is due to Android's system architecture and is necessary for the integration of the iBeacon technology in our new product, the SwitchBot Wallet Finder Card. Location Permissions and Location Services are needed for proper operation on Android devices, even if you don't plan to use the Wallet Finder Card.

We understand that privacy is a top concern, and we want to assure you that SwitchBot will never access, store, or use your location information without your explicit consent. We prioritize the confidentiality of your data and strictly adhere to the privacy policies of App stores and relevant industry standards.

If you have any questions or concerns, we encourage you to consult with

[Google](https://support.google.com/android/)

for further clarification.

As a temporary solution, if you have an iPhone available, we recommend using it for the SwitchBot App,

as iOS does not have this restriction

.

Also, if you're interested in trying out the Wallet Finder Card, we are pleased to offer an exclusive discount. Please contact our customer service team for more details.

For more technical information, you can refer to:

[Android Bluetooth Permissons](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/bluetooth/bt-permissions)

[Apple iBeacon Guide](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/Getting-Started-with-iBeacon.pdf)

### Q&A for the Home Sharing Function

Q: Can I only share some of the devices in the Home with others?

A: No. Currently, when we are about to share a Home with others, all the devices under this Home will be shared.

For more information on the authorization for owner and users in Home Sharing, please refer to the article below.

[Quick Look at the Authorization for Owner and Users in Home Sharing](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/4433743480215)

Q: Can the users use the third-party platform to control the devices in the shared Home?

Q: Other than the shared Home, can users access and control the devices under my non-shared Homes?

A: No, they cannot. Users can only access the Home we have shared.

### Recommended Bluetooth control distance

Last updated: 2023 May 16

Related Products: SwitchBot Bot, SwitchBot Motion Sensor, SwitchBot Contact Sensor,  SwitchBot Lock, SwitchBot Keypad/Keypad Touch, SwitchBot Meter/Meter Plus, SwitchBot Blind Tilt, SwitchBot Curtain, SwitchBot Hub Mini.

SwitchBot App Version: 7.0 or newer

You can communicate with Bluetooth from 80m to 120m outdoors with good visibility, but in ordinary homes, there are walls and other obstacles, so radio waves cannot travel that far.

Although it can reach up to 30m, we recommend a control distance of 10m or less

in consideration of stability.

### The "When" and "And" of Automation

Last Updated：

2023 Nov 29

SwitchBot App Version: 7.8.1 or newer

When (conditions)

1．

Immediate adjustments

are necessary to meet the conditions stipulated in the "When" clause.

For instance, if you specify "SwitchBot Meter temperature above 20.0°C" in the "When" section, the condition "SwitchBot Meter temperature surpasses 20.0°C" is met when the temperature detected by the SwitchBot Meter increases from 19.5°C to 20.5°C - in other words, it must go beyond the 20°C mark. If the temperature has been at 22°C since the time of setting the condition, the automation will not activate.

2． Multiple conditions can be added.

If multiple conditions are set, the system will act upon the fulfillment of any one condition. Subsequently, it will either look to establish the "And" precondition (if one has been designated), or directly initiate an action (if no precondition has been outlined).

And(precondition)

1． The preconditions appended with "and" correspond to the

status

of the device or any other device.

For instance, setting the condition "SwitchBot Meter temperature ≥ 20.0°C" to "and" satisfies the precondition if the temperature detected by the SwitchBot Meter is equal to or exceeds 20°C.

2． Multiple preconditions can be added.

2.1 With numerous prerequisites at play, action will only be activated when all of these prerequisites - or ‘"preconditions" - are satisfied, alongside the conditions specified under "When".

Examples are given below:

When: SwitchBot Meter temperature of 20.0°C or higher.

And: validity 08:00~10:00

and

at home

The action is executed when the smartphone is situated at home, the time falls between 08:00 and 10:00, and the temperature measured by the SwitchBot Meter exceeds 20°C. This occurs when both the "And" precondition and the "When" condition are satisfied.

The action will not be executed if the smartphone is at home, and the time is between 8:00 and 10:00, and the SwitchBot Meter consistently detects a temperature of 24°C. (Automation is not triggered as the "And" precondition is satisfied, but the "When" condition is not met).

2.2 With multiple preconditions in place, the action will be executed if any of these preconditions are fulfilled. To clarify, the action will be initiated when any of these specified "When" preconditions are met.

Examples are given below:

When: SwitchBot Meter temperature 20.0°C or higher

AND: expiry time 08:00~10:00

OR

you are at home

The action is initiated when the smartphone is detected at home, and the temperature registered by the SwitchBot Mete surpasses 20°C.

The action is performed between 8:00 and 10:00 when the temperature recorded by the SwitchBot Meter exceeds 20°C.

3． If you do not need it, you do not have to include "And".

### Third-Party Account Login

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/26002275577239)

But here are a few things we should pay attention to.

1- On the Sign in/Sign up page, please choose Apple, Google, or Amazon on

Part B

, "Sign in by a third-party account".

2- If the email address is linked by a third-party platform in the first place, this email address can only be logged in on

Part B

instead of

Part A

.

3- Password is not required if we choose to sign in by a third-party account. Also, we cannot change the password on the SwitchBot App.

4- When we sign in by a third-party account, the relevant email address cannot be used to sign up and sign in on

Part A

.

5- When we use a Google email to sign up for a SwitchBot account, then we cannot sign in by Google on

Part B

. Also, if this Google email has been used to sign up for an Apple ID or Amazon account, then we cannot sign in by Apple or Amazon on

Part B

either.

6- When we intend to integrate SwitchBot with a third-party platform like Google Home, Alexa, or IFTTT, please choose the corresponding login section.

If we have signed in by a third party account on

Part B

, we can only choose the relevant

Part B

to log in or the integration will fail. This is the same as when we signed up for a SwitchBot account on

Part A

in the first place.

3. Trigger scenes with prescribed voice commands.

Voice example:

“Alexa, turn on [scene name].”

4. Kindly note:

If the skill is already linked with Alexa, the created scene will be automatically added to Alexa with the skill.

"Scenes" in Alexa can only respond to voice commands to

turn them on.

Let me explain with an example.

Scene 1

Scene name: Air conditioner on

Speak when operating with Alexa: "Alexa, turn on 'Air conditioner on'."

Scene 2

Scene name: Air conditioner off

Speak when using with Alexa: “Alexa, turn on 'Air conditioner off'."

### What Should I Do if Shortcuts on Apple Watch Do Not Work?

The reason causes the relevant shortcuts failure is the Apple system defects in the system upgrade of iOS or WatchOS.

Here are the tips to solve the problems:

(Please note the following steps are reprinted from Apple's support forums. We still recommend that you seek support from Apple's official customer service first.)

1- As for the Siri on the Apple Watch doesn't recognize shortcuts.

Please check if the shortcuts are the same on Apple Watch and iPhone. If they are not the same, it might be caused by iCloud or the information transfer mechanism of Siri Shortcuts.

If this phenomenon has a high frequency, please try to pair the Apple Watch with iPhone again.

2- Some issues appear after iOS has a major version upgraded, such as the version to iOS 14.0 last year and iOS 15.0 this year.

As for Issues like Shortcuts do not execute, automation doesn't work, prompt to ask you to allow (null) to visit your data and so on, we can refer to the below methods.

A- Reboot iPhone and Apple Watch

B- Update to the latest system

C- Pair the Apple Watch with iPhone again

D- Delete the shortcut APP on your cellphone > reinstall the shortcut APP > pair the Apple Watch with iPhone again

### What should I do when the SwitchBot Bluetooth devices disconnects from SwitchBot Hubs?

For app version ≥ V9.0

1. Please check the network connection of a hub

If you have multiple hubs under your account, please run the checks on all of them one by one.

Available hub models: Hub 2, Hub Mini, Hub Mini with Matter Enabled, Hub Plus

1- Check the power supply status of all a hub

If the indicator light stays on, it means the power supply is normal. If you have disabled the indicator light, please go to the Settings page to turn it back on and check the status of the indicator light afterward.

If the indicator light blinks slowly in white, it suggests the hub is connecting to the network. In that case, we need to check the network status of the hub.

2- Check the network status of a hub

Go to the Wi-Fi settings and check if the hub is stably connected to the network. If the connection is abnormal, please tap the Edit button and connect the Hub to another 2.4GHz network.

2. Please check if the SwitchBot Bluetooth device can be discovered by a hub

A bluetooth-only device may be connected to any of the hubs as long as a hub can discover the device.

You will need to navigate to Profile > Manage Hubs to check each of the hubs near that device. Generally, you will see a better signal coverage on the hub that is closer to the device. If the device does not show up in any of the lists of the hubs, it could be caused by any of the following things,

the hub fails to pick up the signal at that moment, please refresh the list

the bluetooth device is powered off

the hubs are all too far away from that device and the signal coverage is poor

For app version < V9.0

1. Please check if the Hub Mini/Plus network status is normal.

1- Check the power supply status of the Hub Mini/Plus.

If the Hub Mini/Plus indicator light stays on, it means the power supply is normal. If you have turned off its indicator, please go to the settings page to turn it back on and check the status of the indicator afterward. If the indicator light blinks slowly in white, it suggests the SwitchBot Hub Mini is connecting to the network. In that case, we need to check the network status of the Hub Mini.

2- Check the network status of the Hub Mini.

Go to the Wi-Fi settings and check if the Hub Mini is stably connected to the network. If the connection is abnormal, please tap the Edit button and connect the Hub to another 2.4GHz network.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/attachments/token/8veX7u2Pix7Tc24cz77dwtECE/?name=inline607226516.png)

2. Please check if the SwitchBot Bluetooth device is well connected with the SwitchBot Hub Mini.

1- The SwitchBot Bluetooth devices communicate with the SwitchBot Hub via Bluetooth, and because of this, it is recommended to place the SwitchBot Bluetooth devices closer to the Hub Mini for a more stable connection. Try to adjust the position between them and make sure no other metal or electronic obstacles are blocking the way.

2- If we have multiple SwitchBot Hub Mini devices connected to our account, please ensure the SwitchBot Bluetooth devices connect to the Hub Mini closer to them. We can go to the setting page to set this up.

### Where Did the Cloud Service Item Go?

Last Updated: 2024 Oct 09

SwitchBot App Version: 9.0 or newer

With the release of SwitchBot App version 9.0,

the Cloud Service option has been removed

. There's no longer a need to manually enable it. Now, simply place your Bluetooth devices, like SwitchBot Bot or Curtain, near a Hub (within Bluetooth range), and they will automatically connect to the Hub. No additional setup is required.

Special Note for Meter Users

If you're using a SwitchBot Meter and hadn't enabled Cloud Service before upgrading to version 9.0, you can still access real-time data and device settings by entering the Meter's graph page. However, to continuously store temperature and humidity data to the cloud, you'll need to manually tap the

Store to Cloud

button on the Meter’s graph page. Once done, your data will be uploaded to the cloud for ongoing storage.

### Why Isn’t the Automation Triggered When the Condition Is a Change in Temperature and Humidity and the Precondition Is That It’s Within the Validity Period

Last Updated：

2023 Dec 04

SwitchBot App Version: 7.8 or newer

Why does a change in temperature and humidity (including dew point temperature, VPD, indoor illumination, power usage, etc.) during the validity period fail to trigger the intended automated action? I will illustrate this with an example.

Automation settings：

When: The temperature on the SwitchBot Meter is above 28.0°C.

And: Expiration time is from 18:00 to 20:00 daily.

Then: Air conditioner on.

The automation has been configured as described above; however, it operates inconsistently, running at times and failing at others. What could be the reason for this?

Reasons for the Non-Execution of Automation

The condition specified under 'When' necessitates

an instantaneous change

to be satisfied. Between 18:00 and 20:00, the action is triggered each time the temperature, as detected by the thermo-hygrometer, exceeds 28°C. If the temperature stays over 28℃ before the start time 18:00, the automation will not be activated.

Recommended Automation Settings：

We ask that you set up two automations.

Original Automation

When: The temperature on the SwitchBot Meter is above 28.0°C.

And: Expiration time is from 18:00 to 20:00 daily.

Then: Air conditioner on.

Please add the following automation.

When: Schedule 18:00 daily

And:  SwitchBot Meter temperature ≥ 28.0°C

Then: Air conditioner on.

Using the two automation, the system will activate if the SwitchBot Meter detects a temperature exceeding 28°C before 6:00 PM

### Troubleshooting I'm Using Multiple iPhones and Randomly Getting Logged out of the SwitchBot App

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding the issue of getting automatically logged out of our app, could you please check the following points?
Reason:
When using the same iCloud account across multiple devices, the Device ID gets synced, causing the system to recognize it as a single device. As a result, logging into the same account on another device may lead to being logged out of the first one.
Solutions:
1. Temporary Solution: 
You can create a new account on the other iPhone and share the home with the new account. However, please note that some editing permissions will be unavailable on the new account.  If necessary, you can change the user type of the home member to Admin. The admin has almost the same permissions as the homeowner.
https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/27427300701207

2. Permanent Solution: 
We have a special beta version for iOS that addresses this issue. Here's how to use it:
- First, download and install TestFlight from the App Store (Apple's official beta platform).
- Next, click this link to join the beta: TestFlight Link.
- Once installed, open the app, go to "Profile" and log out.
- After logging out, log back in to complete the process of clearing the device ID.

Important Notes:
- After performing this whole process, you may receive a push notification saying, “Your account has logged in on a new device” or an email with the same message.
- Once the steps are complete, we recommend upgrading to the latest version from the App Store. You can continue using the beta version if you prefer.
-  If you encounter errors like "App not found" or "Connection expired," please contact us for assistance in updating the version.

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact us. We are here to help!
