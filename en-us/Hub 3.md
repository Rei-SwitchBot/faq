### Troubleshooting After Controlling the Air Conditioner with SwitchBot Hub 3, the on/off Status Did Not Reflect in the SwitchBot App.

Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The Hub 3 does not have a feature to sync the air conditioner remote control status with the SwitchBot app. Also, it cannot display the results of using the air conditioner remote on the app. As a result, the on/off status of the remote control displayed on the Hub 3 may not match the status shown in the SwitchBot app.

### Troubleshooting When I Turn on the AC with SwitchBot App, the AC Units Displays Celsius Instead of Fahrenheit, and I Have a Hub 3.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, after reviewing the situation with our R&D team, we'd like to explain what's happening:
When using the SwitchBot app to control your air conditioner, the infrared signals sent by the Hub are based on the Celsius temperature scale. This means your AC unit receives the command in Celsius, causing it to display temperatures in Celsius. Although the SwitchBot app allows you to see and set the temperature in Fahrenheit for your convenience, this conversion happens only within the app, the actual signal that's sent to your AC remains in Celsius.
By comparison, your physical remote sends signals in Fahrenheit, which is why the AC continues to display Fahrenheit when used directly.
We sincerely apologize that our current Hub devices do not support sending infrared commands in Fahrenheit. Our team is continuously working to improve our products and services, and we've shared your feedback with our R&D team for future consideration.
We understand this isn't the ideal experience you expected, and we're truly sorry for the frustration it may have caused. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to let us know. We're here to help.
Thank you for your understanding and support!

### Troubleshooting Only the Power and Mute Buttons on the TV Remote Can Be Learned with SwitchBot Hub 3, Other Buttons Cannot.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
Our hub is only compatible with infrared remote controls. Hybrid infrared/bluetooth remotes can only learn buttons that have an infrared signal. If you are using the "learn buttons" method and can only program the power or mute buttons on your TV remote, it's likely that these are the only buttons with an infrared signal, indicating that the remote is not fully infrared-compatible.
To confirm whether your remote uses infrared, please send us a photo of the unit, and we’ll assess it for you. For detailed specifications, we also recommend checking with the manufacturer directly.
Important Note:
If the remote control of household appliances has "NETFLIX", "Prime Video", Google Assistant, and Alexa voice button, then it is likely to be a remote control that supports Bluetooth or wireless overall. Our hub cannot be used to adding these remotes.

*If you have already provided this information, our team will review it and follow up with you shortly. Thank you for your patience, and please let us know if you need further assistance.
