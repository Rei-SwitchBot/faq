### Learn More About SwitchBot Hub

Last Updated: 2024 Aug 21

Related Products: SwitchBot Hub Mini, SwitchBot Hub Mini Matter Enabled, SwitchBot Hub 2

Using a SwitchBot Hub as a bridge

Currently, all SwitchBot products can be divided into two main categories:

Wi-Fi-integrated, these devices have a built-in Wi-Fi module, such as SwitchBot Hub 2 (Wi-Fi+BLE), SwitchBot Pan/Tilt Cam (Wi-Fi), SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 (Wi-Fi+BLE), SwitchBot Plug Mini (Wi-Fi+BLE).

Bluetooth-only or BLE-only (short for Bluetooth Low Energy), these devices are not connected to the internet directly, but they can be controlled directly using Bluetooth-enabled devices such as your smartphone or a SwitchBot Universal Remote (BLE-only). Bluetooth-only devices consume less power than Wi-Fi-integrated devices, but their communication range is shorter.

However, we can still connect SwitchBot Bluetooth-only devices to the internet via a SwitchBot Hub. If we have a hub under the same account and it is within communication range of the Bluetooth-only devices, we can have access to these devices through the internet.

Depending on your app version, things might look different on how you would configure your devices.

App V9.0

In this upcoming major update, it is more intuitive to enable remote access for your SwitchBot Bluetooth-only devices. You would need Beta access for this version at the moment.

Simply add a SwitchBot Hub to your account, such as Hub 2 or Hub Mini. Make sure the Bluetooth-only devices you own is nearby, preferably in the same room and not blocked out by a wall or a door.

If you are not sure the communication is good or not, you can navigate to Profile > Manage Hubs to check the coverage of each hub and tweak the placement of your hub from there.

Once your hub is all set and connected to the internet, any SwitchBot Bluetooth-only devices nearby would have access to the internet instantly.

You can control the Bluetooth-only devices with voice assistants or build some automations with IFTTT or Home Assistant. In the app, navigate to Profile > Third-party Services and connect to one or more of these services. Each of these third-party services or app usually discovers the Bluetooth-only devices automatically and syncs them to their own apps and platforms.

App V8.8 and previous versions

When using Bluetooth-only devices with a hub, you can navigate to the Settings page of your device and turn on Cloud Services to enable more device features.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998138308503)

After turning on Cloud Services, you'll be able to remotely control your device even when outside Bluetooth range. You can also control your devices using third-party smart assistants like Alexa, Google Home, Siri, and more.

When we turn on Cloud Services for SwitchBot Bluetooth devices, they will communicate with your SwitchBot Hub via Bluetooth. The Hub is also communicating with the Cloud via a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. Every time we try to control a SwitchBot Bluetooth device using our smartphone when not in Bluetooth range, the command will go to the Cloud first, and then be forwarded to your SwitchBot Hub. The Hub will tell the corresponding device what to do via Bluetooth signal when it receives the command. You can find out more by checking the image below:

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998107946391)

Controlling infrared appliances via a SwitchBot Hub

SwitchBot Hub Mini and SwitchBot Hub 2 can do more than build a network bridge for SwitchBot Bluetooth devices. There is also an Infrared receiver and emitter built inside that allows them to learn many Infrared remote control commands to enable you to use your remotes virtually via your smartphone.

Your Hub can learn the Infrared signal, and every time you try to control the corresponding infrared appliance over using your smartphone, the command will go to the Cloud first, then it will be forwarded to your SwitchBot Hub. Your Hub will then emit an infrared signal to control the corresponding appliance. You can find out more below:

### Troubleshooting Changed the Humidity Unit to “Absolute Humidity” in the Switchbot App, but SwitchBot Hub 2 Still Displays “Relative Humidity”

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.

### Troubleshooting When I Turn on the AC with SwitchBot App, the AC Units Displays Celsius Instead of Fahrenheit, and I Have a Hub 2.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, after reviewing the situation with our R&D team, we'd like to explain what's happening:
When using the SwitchBot app to control your air conditioner, the infrared signals sent by the Hub are based on the Celsius temperature scale. This means your AC unit receives the command in Celsius, causing it to display temperatures in Celsius. Although the SwitchBot app allows you to see and set the temperature in Fahrenheit for your convenience, this conversion happens only within the app, the actual signal that's sent to your AC remains in Celsius.
By comparison, your physical remote sends signals in Fahrenheit, which is why the AC continues to display Fahrenheit when used directly.
We sincerely apologize that our current Hub devices do not support sending infrared commands in Fahrenheit. Our team is continuously working to improve our products and services, and we've shared your feedback with our R&D team for future consideration.
We understand this isn't the ideal experience you expected, and we're truly sorry for the frustration it may have caused. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to let us know. We're here to help.
Thank you for your understanding and support!

### Troubleshooting Only the Power and Mute Buttons on the TV Remote Can Be Learned with SwitchBot Hub 2, Other Buttons Cannot.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
Our hub is only compatible with infrared remote controls. Hybrid infrared/bluetooth remotes can only learn buttons that have an infrared signal. If you are using the "learn buttons" method and can only program the power or mute buttons on your TV remote, it's likely that these are the only buttons with an infrared signal, indicating that the remote is not fully infrared-compatible.
To confirm whether your remote uses infrared, please send us a photo of the unit, and we’ll assess it for you. For detailed specifications, we also recommend checking with the manufacturer directly.
Important Note:
If the remote control of household appliances has "NETFLIX", "Prime Video", Google Assistant, and Alexa voice button, then it is likely to be a remote control that supports Bluetooth or wireless overall. Our hub cannot be used to adding these remotes.

*If you have already provided this information, our team will review it and follow up with you shortly. Thank you for your patience, and please let us know if you need further assistance.
