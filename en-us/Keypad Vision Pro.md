### Troubleshooting SwitchBot Keypad Vision Pro's Face Recognition Failed

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. If you are wearing a beard, it might occasionally affect recognition accuracy. We are enhancing our facial recognition algorithm in the upcoming firmware update (expected in approximately 2 months). Thank you for your understanding!

2. Direct sunlight on the device or your face (including backlight situations) can mess with recognition. Try installing it on the side of your doorframe using the included A+B mounting plates to see if it helps.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/624177d0-e393-44d3-9581-87bb561a9142)

3. For optimal facial recognition performance when wearing glasses, sunglasses, helmets or hats, we recommend registering your face twice - once while wearing these items and once without. Similarly, please create separate facial profiles for daytime and nighttime conditions to ensure reliable recognition in different lighting environments. 

4. If your kids are having trouble with face recognition, try having them stand about 90–100 cm (35–39 inches) away from the device when unlocking. Another option is to adjust the mounting height to around 1.2 meters (47 inches), which works well for both adults and kids. If needed, you can also try increasing the recognition sensitivity in the settings for better results.

5. Please update the firmware to V1.5 and set the face recognition sensitivity to high if automatic face recognition activation does not work and manual activation is possible for authentication.

### Troubleshooting My Children's Fingerprints Cannot Be Added to SwitchBot Keypad Vision Pro

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
If other family members can add their fingerprints, it means there is no issue with the Keypad Vision Pro itself.
Children have faster skin metabolism, causing their fingertips' outer layer to renew more frequently. This natural process can make fingerprint patterns less stable and challenging for recognition systems.
When registering, ensure your child's fingertip and sensor area are clean and dry. Try registering the same finger multiple times on different days to help the sensor recognize the pattern better.
If your child still cannot register the fingerprint after several attempts, consider using alternative unlocking methods like passcodes, faces or NFC cards instead. This issue may persist even with a replacement device due to children's natural fingerprint characteristics.
Note:
If your child is unable to unlock the door lock using their fingerprint, try the enhanced fingerprint feature by re-adding the fingerprint that fails to unlock the lock. Follow the guide below to set it up.

<img width="1280" height="518" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a7d9097-1720-42a2-9e85-024aa86067f2" />
