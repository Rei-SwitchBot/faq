### Troubleshooting: Differences in CO2 Readings Between Multiple SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitors)

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
If you have purchased multiple SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitors) and notice differences in their CO2 readings, please follow the steps below to determine if the readings are within the acceptable range and resolve any discrepancies.
1. Position the CO2 monitors in the same location, ensuring there is at least 1 cm of space between each device. Avoid blocking the ventilation ports.
2. Leave the devices undisturbed for five minutes. Then, press the button on the top of each CO2 monitor once to update the display.
3. Check the measurement tolerance.
The CO2 Monitor’s measurement tolerance is ±(50 ppm + 5% of the reading). For example, if Monitor A shows a CO2 concentration of 800 ppm, the acceptable range for the other monitors would be 710–890 ppm. If all readings fall within this range, the devices function correctly.
4. If the readings are outside the acceptable range, use SwitchBot App to calibrate the CO2 monitors.
- Launch SwitchBot App and log in.
- Tap your Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) .
- Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- Tap "Calibrate" on the settings screen.
- Tap "CO2 Monitor".
- Follow the on-screen instructions and place your Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) in a well-ventilated area for 1 minute and then tap "Calibrate".
Note:
The calibration process will take 5 minutes. Please refrain from moving your device during this time.
Calibration can only be performed within the Bluetooth range of the Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor).

### Troubleshooting the Temperature and Humidity Reading Is Different on My SwitchBot Meter Pro and CO2 Monitor

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Make sure the device itself is selected as the data source by going to SwitchBot App -> Meter Pro or CO2 Monitor -> Settings (gear icon) -> Panel Display -> Temp and Humidity Source.
2. Place your Meter Pro and CO2 Monitor in the same location, keeping at least 1 cm (0.4 inches) of distance between them to avoid interference.
3. Wait 30 minutes after placement and check the readings again. 
Normal differences in accuracy:
  1. Temperature:
    1. ±0.4°C at -20°C to 0°C
    2. ±0.2°C at 0°C to 65°C
    3. ±0.3°C at 65°C to 80°C
  2. Humidity:
    1. ±2% (at 25°C, 10%~90%RH)
    2. ±4% (at 25°C, 0%~10%, 90%~99%RH)
4. If the readings still differ significantly, you can manually calibrate the devices by opening SwitchBot App -> Meter Pro or CO2 Monitor -> Settings (gear icon) -> Calibration, and adjust the temperature and humidity readings to match.
Note: When the CO2 update frequency is set to less than 1 minute, the CO2 sensor is continuously active, which may cause the device to heat up slightly and affect the sensor's accuracy. In such cases, you may need to reset the sample frequency interval.
