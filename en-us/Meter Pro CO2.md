### Batteries and Charging Adapter for SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)

SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) is powered by two AA alkaline batteries, which typically last for about one year.  We do not recommend using rechargeable batteries, but if you choose to use them, please ensure that the combined voltage of both batteries does not exceed 3V, as this could potentially damage the device.
SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) can measure from -20°C to 80°C.  However, we recommend using batteries in all SwitchBot products within a temperature range of 5°C to 45°C. Extreme cold or hot environments are not suitable for battery use. In low temperatures, battery efficiency decreases, which can result in insufficient power. High temperatures can cause the battery to react more intensely, leading to rapid discharge or even risks such as leakage or swelling.
In addition to battery power, your SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) can also be powered using a 5V 1A adapter and a Type-C charging cable. This provides you with a convenient alternative to keep your device running without relying solely on batteries.
Note: Charging adapter is not included in the package.

### Difference Between Using SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) Alone and with a Hub

When you use the SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) by itself, it communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This means you can view temperature and humidity and CO2 data in the SwitchBot App as long as your phone is within Bluetooth range of the device. However, when you leave the Bluetooth range, the device will appear offline in the app, and you won’t be able to check the data remotely.
When you pair the Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) with a SwitchBot Hub, the Meter will automatically connect to the network as long as it is within the Bluetooth range of the Hub (SwitchBot App V9.0 or newer required). This allows you to check temperature and humidity and CO2 data anytime and from anywhere through the SwitchBot App, even when you're not at home. Additionally, with the Hub, you can use the Meter’s data as a condition for SwitchBot Automations, triggering actions for other devices based on the temperature or humidity levels.
