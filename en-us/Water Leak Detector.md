### About Leak Alert And Dry Alert of SwitchBot Water Leak Detector with Sensor Cable

Last Updated: 2024 Jul 29

Related Products: SwitchBot Water Leak Detector with Sensor Cable

SwitchBot App Version: 8.7 or newer

When the Water Leak Detector (with Sensor Cable) is set to leak alert mode in the SwitchBot App, both the sensor on the main unit and at the end of the cord are activated. This means that if water is detected by either sensor, an alert will sound.

Conversely, when the Water Leak Detector (with Sensor Cable) is switched to dry alert mode, a warning alert will be triggered upon detecting low water levels from the sensor at the cord's end submerged in water. In this mode, splashings on the main unit's sensor will not activate leak detection.

### Can SwitchBot Water Leak Detector Be Used as a Rain Sensor?

Last Updated: 2024 Apr 30

We

do not recommend

using the water leak detector as a rain sensor.

SwitchBot water leak detector can be used outdoors and detect from a 0.5 mm water level. However, if raindrops fall on the two metal sensors separately as shown in the image below, the alarm will not sound.

As shown in the image below, an alarm will sound if a raindrop connects the two metal sensors.

The sensor requires a certain volume of raindrops to detect rainfall. As a result, the water leak detector may not promptly detect light rain when used as a rainfall sensor. Therefore, using it as such is not recommended.

### Differences Between SwitchBot Water Leak Detector and SwitchBot Water Leak Detector with Sensor Cable

Note:

SwitchBot Water Leak Detector (with Sensor Cable) is designed with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities. However, to conserve battery life, the Wi-Fi connection is only activated when the sensor detects water (or water shortage) and triggers an alert. This means that Wi-Fi remains off during normal use, and it takes around 10 seconds to establish the connection once a leak is detected. As a result, when the water leak alarm triggers other automation routines, you may notice a slight delay. We want to assure you that this is part of the product's design to prioritize power efficiency and is not a defect and appreciate your understanding.

### How to Set SwitchBot Water Leak Detector with Sensor Cable to Sound When the Desired Water Level Is Reached?

Last Updated: 2024 Jul 29

Related Products: SwitchBot Water Leak Detector with Sensor Cable

SwitchBot App Version: 8.7 or newer

If you want your Water Leak Detector with Sensor Cable to sound when the water level in the bathtub reaches a certain level, you can achieve this by setting it to leak alert mode using the SwitchBot App instead of dry alert mode. This is because the dry alert function is meant for detecting low water levels.

However, in leak alert mode, the sensor on the main unit of the Water Leak Detector with Sensor Cable will also be active, and the alarm may be triggered by splashing water droplets. To avoid any issues, it is recommended to use a cover or similar protection.

Set Water Leak Detector with Sensor Cable to leak alert:

SwitchBot App -> your Water Leak Detector with Sensor Cable -> Mode -> Leak alert

### At What Battery Level Does SwitchBot Water Leak Detector Issue a Low Battery Notification?

SwitchBot Water Leak Detector will issue a low battery notification when the battery level drops to 20% or below. The detector is equipped with both Wi-Fi and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) communication functions. However, to conserve power, the Wi-Fi communication is typically in a suspended state during normal operation. Wi-Fi connectivity will automatically resume under the following two conditions, triggering notifications or alerts:
1. When the battery level drops to 20% or below
2. When a water leak is detected
While basic operations are maintained even in low battery mode, to ensure stable performance, we recommend replacing the batteries as soon as you receive a low battery notification. For continuous usage or critical installation locations, proactive maintenance is highly advised.
