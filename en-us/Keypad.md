Products

: SwitchBot Keypad Touch

SwitchBot Keypad Touch is currently able to configure up to 100 fingerprints.

There are three types of fingerprint settings to choose from. Permanent fingerprints, emergency fingerprints, and temporary fingerprints.

Permanent fingerprints

, when set, have no time limit and will be available to use permanently.

Temporary fingerprints

can be set to expire after any time between 1 hour and five years.

Emergency fingerprints

can help send an emergency alert to someone via email when the SwitchBot Lick door lock is unlocked using your emergency fingerprint

(SwitchBot Hub Mini required).

Please note: you can set up to 90 fingerprints at any one time a period of time with an additional 10 emergency fingerprints. In the event that the number of fingerprints set exceeds your maximum limit, current fingerprints must be deleted and a new fingerprint can then be set.

When it comes to children, their skin is very soft and the size of their fingerprint changes as they grow. As a result, there is currently no guarantee that the registered fingerprint will be authenticated.

### How to Install SwitchBot Keypad?

There are two ways to install the SwitchBot Keypad. We can attach the Keypad to the wall with adhesive tape, or install it with screws.

[Embedded Content](//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ag5R_seaMgQ)

Install with screws ( Recommended )

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998138037911)

Before installation, you will need

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998138039191)

Step 1 - Confirm Installation Position

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998138040983)

Stick the alignment sticker to where you'd like to install the Keypad and use a pencil to mark the positions of the screw holes.

Note: Installation position of the Keypad should be within 5 meters (16.4 feet) away from your lock.

Step 2 - Drill Holes

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998138043543)

When installing on more rugged surfaces like concrete or brick:

Drill holes at the marked positions using the electric drill ( with a 6 mm [15/64"] drill bit ), then use the rubber hammer to hammer the expansion bolts into the wall.

When installing on surfaces like wood or plaster:

Drill holes at the marked positions using the electric drill (with a 2.8 mm [7/64"] drill bit). No need to use expansion bolts.

Step 3 - Attach Mounting Plate to the Wall

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998107696407)

Affix the mounting plate to the wall using screws. Make sure the mounting plate is firmly attached and there should be no excess movement when you press either side. (If the surface is uneven, you may need to place two rubber rings at the bottom screw holes of the mounting plate.)

Steps 4 - Attach keypad to Mounting Plate

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998107697687)

Align the two metal round buttons at the back of Keypad with the two round locating holes at the bottom of mounting plate. Then slide Keypad downwards along the mounting plate until it can not go any further.

Note: Removal alerts will be triggered every time the Keypad is removed from the mounting plate. So we recommend installing the Keypad with screws.

Install with Adhesive Tape

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998138051863)

Step 1 - Attach Mounting Plate to the Wall

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998138053655)

Attach adhesive tape to the back of mounting plate, then stick the mounting plate to the wall at the installation position. Press the mounting plate against the wall for 2 minutes to ensure it is firm. (Make sure the installation surface is smooth and clean. Make sure the temperature of the adhesive tape and installation surface is higher than 0°C.)

Step 2 - Attach keypad to Mounting Plate

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998107707543)

Align the two metal round buttons at the back of Keypad with the two round locating holes at the bottom of mounting plate. Then slide Keypad downwards along the mounting plate until it can not go any further.

### Quick start and installation instructions for SwitchBot Keypad

It takes about 10 minutes to install the SwitchBot Keypad.

We can use the Screw Kit (Two 3.5 x 25 mm [#6 x 1"] screws, two expansion bolts) to install the Keypad to the wall or use the alignment sticker to attach the Keypad to the wall.

Before installing the Keypad to the wall, we can find a favorable position and hold the Keypad to the wall with our hand. Then try to unlock the SwitchBot Lock via the Keypad. If the Keypad can open the SwitchBot Lock successfully, then this position is acceptable for the Keypad. After all these confirmations, we can drill the hole or attach the sticker to install the Keypad.

Please refer to the guidance in the manual.

### What to Do If SwitchBot Keypad Cannot Be Installed on the Mounting Plate?

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/26001907081495)

If the SwitchBot Keypad cannot be installed on the Mounting Plate, please refer to the steps below to troubleshoot.

1- Check whether the battery cover is firmly attached. Keep the battery cover flat to cover the cabinet and make it even with the edge. Then try again to install it on the Mounting Plate.

2- If the problem persists, please check whether the wall is not flat, which leads to the gap between the wall and Mounting Plate being too close. In this case, we need to attach the rubber ring to the screw hole on the back of the Mounting Plate to make sure there is enough gap between the Mounting Plate and the wall. We can find the rubber ring in the box of the Keypad.
