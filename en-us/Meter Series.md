### Batteries and Charging Adapter for SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)

Last Updated: 2024 Sep 20

Related Products: SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)

SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) is powered by two AA alkaline batteries, which typically last for about one year. We do not recommend using rechargeable batteries, but if you choose to use them, please ensure that the combined voltage of both batteries does not exceed 3V, as this could potentially damage the device.

SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) can measure from -20°C to 80°C. However, we recommend using batteries in all SwitchBot products within a temperature range of 5°C to 45°C. Extreme cold or hot environments are not suitable for battery use. In low temperatures, battery efficiency decreases, which can result in insufficient power. High temperatures can cause the battery to react more intensely, leading to rapid discharge or even risks such as leakage or swelling.

In addition to battery power, your

SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) can also be powered using a 5V 1A adapter and a Type-C charging cable.

This provides you with a convenient alternative to keep your device running without relying solely on batteries.

Note: Charging adapter is not included in the package.

### Can I calibrate my SwitchBot Meter? How?

Updated: Nov 23rd, 2022

Applicable Products: SwitchBot Meter, SwitchBot Meter Plus

The short answer is "yes," but we have a range of tips to help make sure this goes smoothly.

First, you will need an accurate reference for temperature and/or humidity. Each value is calibrated separately, and you can choose to calibrate one, both, or neither as necessary. The accuracy of the uncalibrated Meter can be found in the manual.

Calibration is only intended to correct for small variations (typically up to a few degrees or around 5% relative humidity).

WITH A REFERENCE DEVICE

If you have a trusted thermometer or hygrometer that you know to be very accurate, you can use it as a reference. Simply place it next to the SwitchBot Meter in a stable environment, let them sit for at least 30 minutes to acclimate to each other, be sure you have an updated reading, and then use the calibration controls (shown below) to adjust the SwitchBot Meter to match the reference.

To access the Meter settings, tap the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Meter you want to control on the SwitchBot App homepage. Then click "Calibration."

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/26002261188375)

TEMPERATURE

If you don't have a reference device, you can still calibrate your Meter. Ice water makes a great temperature reference. Just mix up a bowl of ice water with a good even mixture of ice and water. Give it a good stir and let it sit while you seal your SwitchBot Meter in a zip-top baggie. Get as much air out of the bag as possible. Place the SwitchBot Meter (inside the baggie) into the ice water mixture. It's better to leave the zip-top out of the water, just in case it doesn't seal entirely.

Give the SwitchBot Meter at least 30 minutes to acclimate, be sure you have an updated reading, and then adjust the calibration controls so the value reads exactly 32.0°F (0.0°C)

If you have any difficulties, consider these tips:

First, make sure that when you run the test, you have removed as much air from the bag as possible.

Second, make sure that the screen side of the Meter is facing the water.

Third, make sure the Meter is submerged in the ice water as much as possible, for the reason that the plastic case, the battery, and the other components need to be brought to equilibrium.

HUMIDITY

For calibrating humidity, the "salt test" is quite popular, and instructions can be found readily on the Internet. The chemical principle is sound and it can work quite well, but we find it to be difficult to execute consistently and accurately.

Calibrating to an inaccurate reference can be worse than not calibrating at all, so we prefer the Boveda One-Step Hygrometer Calibration Kit, available for less than $10 on Amazon.

Just open the baggie, seal your SwitchBot Meter inside, and place it at room temperature in a location with minimal temperature variations. Let it sit undisturbed for at least 24-36 hours, be sure you have an updated reading, and then adjust the calibration controls to read exactly 75.0% humidity. Keep the calibration kit sealed, and you can use it multiple times for at least three months after the initial test.

### Can I use Meter alone, or do I need a Hub Plus/Mini?

It all depends on whether or not you need to monitor your Meter remotely and/or if you want to back up or sync your data with others on the SwitchBot cloud.

To use the SwitchBot Meter alone? You can either check the readings from the LED screen directly, just like the traditional thermometer and hygrometer.

Alternatively, you can use the SwitchBot App to pair your mobile phone with the Meter. This unlocks more possibilities like getting the last 36 days of historical data (via Bluetooth), getting alert notifications, calibrating the Meter, etc.

The Meters use BLE to communicate, so on their own, they are limited to Bluetooth range (e.g. around the house - like a Bluetooth speaker).

If you would like to monitor SwitchBot Meters remotely (e.g. away from the house), you need to use them in conjunction with a SwitchBot Hub (Plus/Mini), which relays the data of any in-range SwitchBot Meters to the internet using your local Wi-Fi.

If you have a SwitchBot Hub (Plus/Mini), you can turn on the Cloud Service for the Meter. It means your data is always being uploaded and backed up automatically and boosts the speed when you check historical data (via the Internet). With Cloud Service enabled, the Meter also works with Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri Shortcuts, and IFTTT.

If you have a SwitchBot Hub (Plus/Mini) near your Meter, you can make all SwitchBot products work together, e.g. when the temperature is too high, it will turn on the air conditioner with the SwitchBot Hub (Plus/Mini) via infrared, or turn on a Fan with the Bot (by mechanically pushing a button).

Note:

With the "Scene" feature, you can set certain conditions to trigger actions of SwitchBot devices or IR appliances.



---
### Can I use multiple SwitchBot Meters with my one app?

Yes. Multiple SwitchBot Meters can be used on the same SwitchBot App, with the same account logged in.

In fact, a lot of customers use more than one Meter in a wide variety of ways.

There's no limit to the number of Meters you can pair with a single mobile device. Users can connect multiple Meters simultaneously on the same cellphone. Also, a single Meter can be paired to multiple cellphone at the same time.

However, if we want to use the Meters in conjunction with a SwitchBot Hub (Plus/Mini), the rules will be slightlt different. One SwitchBot Hub (Plus/Mini) can connect up to 120 Meters. If more Meters are going to be connected to the Hub (Plus/Mini), we should consider adding another Hub (Plus/Mini).

Also, we can have multiple Hubs on one account. They can be in the same location or they can be in separate locations.

### Comfort Level Display on SwitchBot Meter Pro

Last Updated: 2024 Nov 04

Related Products: SwitchBot Meter Pro, SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)

SwitchBot App Version: 9.3 or newer

By default, the comfort range is set between

18°C to 28°C for temperature and 30% to 70% for humidity

. You can adjust and customize this comfort range in the SwitchBot App according to your preferences.

When displaying local temperature and humidity on the Meter Pro screen, the comfort range will automatically align with the Meter Pro’s configured settings. However, if you set the screen to show data from other SwitchBot meters, the comfort display will adjust according to the data source.

For example:

If the top section of the screen shows Meter Pro data and the bottom shows local temperature and humidity, both sections will follow the Meter Pro’s comfort settings.

If the top section shows Meter Pro data and the bottom shows data from an Outdoor Meter, the top will follow the Meter Pro’s settings, while the bottom will reflect the comfort range set for the Outdoor Meter.

If the comfort indicator arrow is not displayed on your Meter Pro screen, please check both the temperature and humidity settings.

The comfort level is only achieved when both the set temperature and humidity ranges are reached simultaneously

.

You can check the default and adjust comfort range in the following order:

Launch SwitchBot App and log in.

Tap your Meter Pro.

Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.

Tap "Comfort Level" on the settings screen.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/26504215679511)

Note:

Currently, SwitchBot Meter, Hub 2, and Hub Mini Matter Enabled do not support comfort level, so they will not display comfort level when synced to the Meter Pro as a data source.

### Data Synchronization, Saving, and Deletion for SwitchBot Meter

Related Products: SwitchBot Meter, SwitchBot Meter Plus, SwitchBot Outdoor Meter, SwitchBot Meter Pro, SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)
SwitchBot App Version: 9.1 or newer
Data Storage

The SwitchBot Meter and Meter Pro CO2 Monitor store the most recent 36 days (Meter Plus, Outdoor Meter and Meter Pro can store 68 days) of temperature and humidity data on the device itself. Since data is transferred via Bluetooth, if the data hasn’t been read for a while, it might take a moment to display the complete graph when you access the history in the app. We appreciate your patience in this case.

Note: As long as the SwitchBot App isn’t uninstalled, temperature and humidity data will be stored indefinitely as cache. You can also export this recorded data anytime.

If you use the Meter with one of our hubs, up to two years of temperature and humidity data can be stored in the cloud. You can also export saved data as needed.

When paired with a hub, data transfers happen over Wi-Fi, allowing for faster data reading.

Data Synchronization

There are two ways to synchronize the data from the SwitchBot Meter.

If using the Meter alone:

As long as you are within Bluetooth range, simply tap the Meter in the SwitchBot App, and the data will automatically download from the device.

When paired with a hub:

Tapping the Meter in the SwitchBot App will sync data from the SwitchBot server. To sync data, the following conditions must be met:

The hub is added to the same account as the Meter.
The hub is connected to the internet.
The Meter is within the hub’s Bluetooth range.
Data Deletion

When connected to a hub:

To delete all saved data from the app and the server, go to the SwitchBot App → Meter → Delete Data. This will also delete any data stored on the Meter itself.

When using the Meter alone:

Tapping the "Delete Data" button will clear the cache data on your phone. This will also delete any data stored on the Meter itself.

By pressing the button on the Meter for 15 seconds, the device will be reset, and its data will be deleted. However, the cached data on your phone will remain.

Note: Before performing any of the actions above, we recommend tapping the "Export Data" button at the bottom of the Meter’s data screen to back up your data.

### Difference Between Using SwitchBot Meter Alone and with a Hub

Last Updated: 2024 Oct 18

Related Products: SwitchBot Meter, SwitchBot Meter Plus, SwitchBot Outdoor Meter, SwitchBot Meter Pro, SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor), SwitchBot Hub

SwitchBot App Version: 9.1 or newer

When you use the SwitchBot Meter by itself, it communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This means you can view temperature and humidity data in the SwitchBot App as long as your phone is within Bluetooth range of the device. However, when you leave the Bluetooth range, the device will appear offline in the app, and you won’t be able to check the data remotely.

When you pair the SwitchBot Meter with a SwitchBot Hub, the Meter will automatically connect to the network as long as it is within the Bluetooth range of the Hub (SwitchBot App V9.0 or newer required). This allows you to check temperature and humidity data anytime and from anywhere through the SwitchBot App, even when you're not at home. Additionally, with the Hub, you can use the Meter’s data as a condition for SwitchBot Automations, triggering actions for other devices based on the temperature or humidity levels.

### Does SwitchBot Meter Pro Have a Built-In Backlight?

Last Updated: 2024/10/21

Related Products: SwitchBot Meter, SwitchBot Meter Plus, SwitchBot Meter Pro, SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)

Including Meter Pro,

all SwitchBot Meter products do not have built-in backlights

. Adding a backlight could generate heat, which may affect the accuracy of the temperature and humidity readings. We understand this may be an inconvenience, and we apologize for any frustration this might cause.



---
### Does SwitchBot Meter use Wi-Fi?

Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are under the category of wireless technology. SwitchBot Meter uses Bluetooth, but a Wi-Fi option can be easily added.

The SwitchBot Meter uses the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol (BLE) to communicate. So on its own, the Meter is limited to Bluetooth range (e.g. around the house - like a Bluetooth speaker).

If we want to monitor SwitchBot Meters remotely (e.g. away from the house), we need to use them in conjunction with a SwitchBot Hub (Plus), which relays the data of any in-range SwitchBot Meter to the internet using our local Wi-Fi network.

The reason why the Meter uses the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol (BLE) to communicate is that it's more cost-effective and less power-consuming than using Wi-Fi, leading the batteries to last a lot longer (in most cases for a year) and the sample rate of the Meter can be a lot higher than using Wi-Fi. A lot of Meters with on-board Wi-Fi will sample once every 15 minutes instead of once every 2 minutes which is what the SwitchBot Meter is capable of, and their batteries die after a couple of weeks instead of a year or more. Changing battery frequently would be a real annoyance when we're placing the Meter to some hard-to-reach places like a crawlspace under a house.

So with a SwitchBot Hub (Plus/Mini), we can not only add Wi-Fi capability to the SwitchBot Meter but due to the favorable price, we can also have a larger array of energy-efficient Meters pushing to the cloud for remotely monitoring for a lot less cost. As for the Cloud Service, there is no extra fee once we purchase a SwitchBot Hub (Plus/Mini).

We may eventually move in the direction of Wi-Fi once it's possible to have more efficient systems.

### How Long Will My SwitchBot Meter/Meter Plus Battery Life Last?

Updated: Feb 15th, 2023

Related Products: SwitchBot Meter, SwitchBot Meter Plus

1. You'll find 2 AAA batteries inside Meter/MeterPlus, which can be used for approximately 1 year (Panasonic batteries are recommended). While Meter/Meter Plus can measure temperatures down to -20°C, it is recommended that Meter/Meter Plus be used at temperatures between -10°C and 60°C, as the life of your device may be shortened if used in extreme environments. Depending on the temperature and the frequency of data readings, service life may also be shortened.

2. When replacing batteries, open your device cover on the back at the bottom of Meter/Meter Plus, remove the old batteries, and insert new ones. Please note: if the positive (+) and negative (-) ends of your batteries are in the opposite direction when installing, this may damage your device.

3. Ni-MH rechargeable batteries can be used, but make sure the output voltage is between 2.2V to 3.6V.

4. In general, it is recommended to use rechargeable batteries when temperature is between 5℃ and 45℃. If the temperature is lower than this your batteries may not discharge properly. Also, if your batteries are used at high temperatures, it may easily deteriorate and leak having a negative impact on Meter/Meter Plus.

Please Note: we recommend removing batteries should you not need to use your device for a long period of time.



---
### How do I export my SwitchBot Meter data from the App?

Data can be exported from the App in CSV format, which can be opened with Excel and many other data software platforms.

When you select a Meter on the SwitchBot App homepage, you will be taken to the Meter Settings page. Scrolling all the way down below the graphs to the bottom, you will find an "Export Data" button that allows you to download all the data as a spreadsheet in CSV format. The form works with Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet software.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25991474592023)



---
### How many days of readings can the SwitchBot Meter store? And what happens after that?

Both the Meter and the APP store data.

The Meter automatically maintains a backup of the most recent 36 days of readings. Even if we are away from the Meter, it will continue to record the temperature and humidity of the surroundings. When the record reaches 36 days, it starts to overwrite the oldest data points.

Once the data is picked up by the APP, it will be stored indefinitely by the app on your mobile device.

Likewise, once the data is picked up by a SwitchBot Hub Plus/Mini (when a Hub Mini/Plus is used in conjunction with the Meter), it will be stored indefinitely in the cloud service of SwitchBot Meter.



---
### How the Alert of Meter works? Why it Can't Work?

To explain this very explicitly, here is the background logic:

1. to use push notification for Android users, you absolutely need a Hub Mini or Hub Plus.

2. to use push notification for iOS users, you may use it with or without a Hub Mini or Hub Plus.

For Android User:

The push notification happens from the Cloud, so the push notification is issued if the trigger stays for more than 2 minutes.

For example, if the trigger is pushed notification / Scene action when the temperature is higher than 25 degrees/humidity is lower than 60%, then if the temperature goes higher than 25 degrees/humidity goes lower than 60% and stays for more than 2 minutes, the push notification / Scene action will be issued. If the temperature jumps back and forth within the 2 minutes window, the notification/action will not be issued.

For iOS User:

The push notification happens either from the Bluetooth Beacon or from the Cloud depending on the situation below.

When without a Hub Mini

, as long as your iPhone is within Bluetooth range of the Meter, push notification will be issued right after the trigger is matched without delay from Bluetooth Beacon. You cannot use a Scene without a Hub Mini.

For example, if the trigger is pushed notification when the temperature is higher than 25 degrees/humidity is lower than 60%, then if the temperature goes higher than 25 degrees/humidity goes lower than 60% and stays for more than 2 minutes, the push notification will be issued. If the temperature/humidity jumps back and forth, there might be multiple notifications.

When with a Hub Mini, and the Meter does not enable Cloud Service

, the situation is the same as without a Hub Mini.

When with a Hub Mini and the Meter enable Cloud Service

, the situation is the same as Android users.

* The sampling interval of the Meter is 4s.

* The data logging of the Meter on Bluetooth and the cloud are 2 min.

### SwitchBot Meter Data Update Frequency

Last Updated: 2024/09/10

Related Products: SwitchBot Meter, SwitchBot Meter Plus, SwitchBot Meter Pro, SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor)

SwitchBot Meter collects data every 4 seconds and saves it every minute.

After being connected to a Hub series device, the temperature and humidity data is uploaded to the SwitchBot server. The interval displayed in the app and the export file will depend on how much the temperature changes in the environment. For instance, if there are small temperature changes, it will record every 30 minutes. If there are larger changes, it may record every 10 minutes or even every 2 minutes.

[Device Name] refers to the name of the device.

Humidity:

Method 1:

Alexa, ask SwitchBot to tell me the humidity of [Device Name].

[Device Name] refers to the name of the device.

Method 2:

First, invoke the custom skill with the voice command:

Alexa, open SwitchBot.

Alexa, active SwitchBot.

Then, ask Alexa about the humidity. Voice commands:

Alexa, what is the humidity of [Device Name]?

Alexa, tell me the humidity of [Device Name].

Alexa, humidity of [Device Name].

Note：

1． Due to Alexa's specifications, if the device name does not include the keyword "Meter," the voice command may not be recognized correctly. Good examples: Study Room Meter, office Meter.

2． If there are multiple Meter devices linked to your SwitchBot account, asking Alexa for the humidity may result in a response based on the data from the first paired thermometer/hygrometer device. We are currently negotiating with Alexa to resolve this issue and ask for your patience and understanding until improvements are made.

### Why location permission is needed for Meter's Bluetooth Alert feature on iOS devices?

According to Apple's policies, location permission is now needed for the Bluetooth Alert (iBeacon) feature on iOS devices.*

Thus, the SwitchBot App must get access to location service to make Meter's alert feature work properly.

SwitchBot never tracks users' location information, nor do we share it with any third-party platforms.

If you are still concerned about it, we recommend you pair your Meter with a Hub Plus and enable the Cloud Service of the Meter. In this way, your Meter's alert notificatIon will go through the Internet instead of Bluetooth, therefore location permission is not needed after we have connected it to the SwitchBot app.

### Will the Meter Sticker Damage My Wall Paint?

The short answer is yes if you take off it in a wrong way.

To take off the Meter Sticker, you could use a piece of floss and a hairdryer to keep it damage-free. First, warm up the adhesive with a hairdryer. 30 seconds or so seems to be about right. Next, use dental floss or fishing line to gently cut through the adhesive.

### How to Sync Temperature and Humidity Data Stored in SwitchBot Meter to Cloud?

Related Products: SwitchBot Outdoor Meter, SwitchBot Meter, SwitchBot Meter Plus
SwitchBot App Version：9.0 or newer
Precondition

Normally, I use my Meter connected to a Hub at home, syncing all the data to the cloud. One day, I took it out with me, and when I got back, I realized I couldn’t view the data recorded while I was away. Why does this happen?

Reason

Starting from SwitchBot App V9.0, the "Cloud Service" option was removed from the settings. Instead, when you tap on the Meter in the app, a “Store Data to Cloud” button now appears at the bottom of the graph screen. Tapping this button enables the cloud storage of temperature and humidity data, functioning the same as activating the previous "Cloud Service" option.

However, data recorded via Bluetooth and data saved to the cloud are stored through separate processes and do not merge. Once you enable the “Store Data to Cloud” feature, the app will prioritize displaying data stored in the cloud. As a result, data recorded via Bluetooth while away from the Hub will no longer appear on the graph screen.

Solution

If you often take the Meter away from home, here are some tips to ensure you can access all your data:

1. Do not tap the “Store Data to Cloud” button to avoid saving data to the cloud.

2. Consider purchasing a  second Meter to use exclusively when on the go.

3. If you’ve already enabled the “Store Data to Cloud” feature and want to view Bluetooth data recorded while away, try below:

SwitchBot App≤9.5

You can remove the device from the app and re-add it to access the data recorded while away. However, if the device remains connected to the Hub (meaning you have enabled the “Store Data to Cloud” feature again), you’ll need to repeat this process of removing and re-adding it each time you take it out.

SwitchBot App≥V9.6:

If the Meter has been disconnected from the Hub for over one hour, you can recover and sync the missing temperature and humidity data to the chart.
After reconnecting the Meter to the Hub, ensure the device is within Bluetooth range. Open the SwitchBot App, select the Meter, and follow the data recovery message displayed at the top of the chart screen to complete the recovery process.
Only Home Owner and Administrators have permission to recover data. Members will not see the data recovery message on their smartphones.
If your Meter has been disconnected from the Hub for less than one hour, the data recovery message will not appear. Additionally, there may be a delay of approximately 10 minutes before the server detects and confirms the disconnection with the Hub. It is possible to sync the data for the last 20 days.

Note:

The Meter can store up to 36 days of data locally when connected via Bluetooth. After this, older data will be overwritten. To prevent data loss, ensure you load and export the data in time.

### How often is the temperature and humidity data updated on the Android widget for SwitchBot?

The SwitchBot Meter collects data every 4 seconds and saves it every minute.
When using the widget, due to limitations of the smartphone system, it may take at least 15 minutes for the data to update.
There is a time delay between the temperature and humidity data in the widget compared to that displayed in the SwitchBot app and device. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.


---
### How often is the temperature and humidity data updated on the widget for SwitchBot?

Apple hasn’t officially specified how often widgets refresh their data. However, we can confirm that when the SwitchBot App is open, the iOS widget updates the temperature and humidity data approximately every 5 minutes. Since the SwitchBot Meter collects data every 4 seconds and saves it every minute, there may be a slight delay between what you see in the widget and the actual readings in the app or on the device itself. We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause and appreciate your understanding.

### Troubleshooting: Differences in CO2 Readings Between Multiple SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitors)

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
If you have purchased multiple SwitchBot Meter Pro (CO2 Monitors) and notice differences in their CO2 readings, please follow the steps below to determine if the readings are within the acceptable range and resolve any discrepancies.
1. Position the CO2 monitors in the same location, ensuring there is at least 1 cm of space between each device. Avoid blocking the ventilation ports.
2. Leave the devices undisturbed for five minutes. Then, press the button on the top of each CO2 monitor once to update the display.
3. Check the measurement tolerance.
The CO2 Monitor’s measurement tolerance is ±(50 ppm + 5% of the reading). For example, if Monitor A shows a CO2 concentration of 800 ppm, the acceptable range for the other monitors would be 710–890 ppm. If all readings fall within this range, the devices function correctly.
4. If the readings are outside the acceptable range, use SwitchBot App to calibrate the CO2 monitors.
- Launch SwitchBot App and log in.
- Tap your Meter Pro (CO2 Monitor) .
- Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- Tap "Calibrate" on the settings screen.
