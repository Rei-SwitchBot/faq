### How Many SwitchBot Smart Radiator Thermostats Can Be Paired with One SwitchBot Home Climate Panel?

Up to five Smart Radiator Thermostats can be paired with one SwitchBot Home Climate Panel. Once paired, you can use the Home Climate Panel to set all five Radiator Thermostats to the same temperature. 
Important Note:
The Home Climate Panel communicates with thermostats via Bluetooth. When using one Home Climate Panel to control multiple thermostats, please make sure that all the thermostats remain within the Bluetooth range of the panel. If your account also has a Hub, the Home Climate Panel and Smart Radiator Thermostats will be automatically networked when within the Bluetooth range of the Hub, allowing you to use the panel to control the thermostat beyond the Bluetooth range.
