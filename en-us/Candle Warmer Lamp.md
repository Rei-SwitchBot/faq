### Is It Possible to Use SwitchBot Candle Warmer Lamp in Households with Pets?

The Candle Warmer Lamp is designed to function without an open flame, making it a safe choice for households with pets. Please keep the following guidelines in mind when using it:
Place the Candle Warmer Lamp on a stable surface to prevent pets from accidentally knocking it over.
Extended use may cause the surface of the lamp to become hot. Make sure pets do not accidentally come into contact with it.  
If your pet is sensitive to scents, choose candles with gentle fragrances or low volatility. Additionally, to prevent continuous fragrance diffusion in an enclosed space for prolonged periods, regular ventilation is highly recommended.
