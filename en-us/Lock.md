### Is It Possible to Install SwitchBot Lock on a Steel Door?

Last Updated: 2023 July 28

Related Products: SwitchBot Lock

1. SwitchBot Lock is equipped with a magnetic sensor. Should you install this device onto a steel door, the Auto-Lock function may cease to work.

2. SwitchBot Lock may be affixed to your door using double-sided tape. In some living environments, you may find problems may occur, such as the double-sided tape peeling causing SwitchBot Lock to fall off due to thermal expansion and contraction.

3. The coating on steel doors may prevent your device from being attached securely using double-sided tape.

4. To prevent such issues, you may want to:

※Attach your SwitchBot Lock to your door using screws.

※Ensure your device is used in a temperature environment that ranges between 15°C to 35°C.

Note：

For iOS devices, if you're using the SwitchBot App and don't receive notifications at the set time, it's not a bug. This is due to a limitation with the iOS system: notifications won't be delivered if you are actively using the SwitchBot App at the time the notification is scheduled to be sent. iOS only sends app notifications when the app is running in the background or the device is locked, among other conditions. So, if you remain in the SwitchBot App when the conditions for a notification are met, you will not receive the notification.

There are no such restrictions for Android devices.

1. Make sure there is enough space between your door lock and SwitchBot Lock.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/23858334908567)

Please note: This device is not suitable for installation in areas that may include gaps or cracks.

2. Make sure your installation surface is flat and dry.

The recommended operating environment for 3M adhesive is 15°C to 35°C.

Please do not install your adhesive in any environments that contain moisture.

Do not install on uneven surfaces.

Please clean your installation surface with an alcohol swab before beginning.

If your installation surface is smooth like a mirror, an extra adhesive may be required.

If your door lock makes it more difficult to install SwitchBot Lock due to its design or other reasons. Please contact us to see if there are any Mounting Plate accessories that we can provide you with.

3. When installing on surfaces that might have wallpaper, please make sure there are no bulges present and that your installation surface is smooth and flat.

4. The adhesiveness of double-sided tape may easily deteriorate if installed near heat sources.

※Related Posts:

6. When replacing double-sided tape, please ensure you remove the old double-sided tape cleanly before replacing it. If old residue from double-sided tape is left on your mounting surface, it may weaken the adhesive strength when re-installing, causing your device to fall down once mounted.

7. When attaching, please press and hold for about 2 minutes to fix the product in place.

8. Please allow 24 hours for the product to be firmly fixed before using.

### What to Do If My SwitchBot Lock Gets Jammed?

Last Updated: 2024 Jun 20

Related Products: SwitchBot Lock

Firmware Version: 6.8 or newer

1. If you are locked out and can not enter your home, please check to see if you can use the emergency unlock function to unlock your door.

*Please be sure to bring the key with you when you leave the house in case the battery runs out or the lock itself does not work. If the emergency lock doesn't help you resolve your issue and a lock-opening service is required, we will not be responsible for your lock-opening service fee. Thanks for your understanding.

2. If you are at home, please check that the center of the thumbturn of the lock is coaxial with the center of the knob with respect to installation. If it is not aligned correctly, your SwitchBot Lock may be subjected to excessive rotational force to locking and unlocking. If your SwitchBot Lock is used for a long time in this condition, it may get jammed, or the device itself may fall.

※I mages showing installation where position not coaxial

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998493149463)

3. If the fixed tail on the lock body has been removed, please manually fix the joint slider and adjust the center of the knob and the center of the lock thumbturn to a coaxial position, as shown in the video below, before reinstalling your SwitchBot Lock again.

※Related Post:

4. If you are purchasing a new Lock, please install it as shown in the video below.

https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uzOVKj5P6s

※If the installation adjustment successfully resolves your jamming issue, you will not need to do anything else.

===============================================================

5. After reconfirming installation, remove SwitchBot Lock from the mounting adapter and try to operate the lock (or emergency unlocking) function using our app.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998506480535)

6. If the lock does not turn when operating via our app, please provide a video of your SwitchBot Lock not turning. We will provide after-sales warranty service to help you resolve your issue (replacement of new device and collection of your defective device).

========================================================

7. If your lock turns normally when using our app to operate, this usually means the issue is not with SwitchBot Lock itself. Please request for firmware update.

8. Please reinstall and calibrate your SwitchBot Lock once your update is complete, and make sure that the battery used is CR123A 3V/1500mAh and that there is sufficient remaining battery power. A low battery level will affect the rotational force of the Lock.

*Related Post:

9. Please open the door, unlock the lock with the SwitchBot App, and check if it is jammed.

9-1>If the lock cannot handle the front door lock at this time due to jamming, please provide a video of the jamming.

9-2>If the jamming is not occurring, please close the door and lock it with the SwitchBot App. If the door can be locked without any problem, it appears that the front door lock can be handled by the rotational force of the lock. If you experience a jam when locking, the door may not be closing properly, and the latch may be hitting the door frame. Please check the door opening and closing condition again before locking. If you still experience the jamming, please take a video of the jamming. We will respond with a refund or return as soon as possible.

10. If you are still experiencing the Jammed even with the lastest firmware, even though there is no problem with rotational force, please contact us with a video of the jamming.

This is a complicated troubleshooting process.

When you contact us, it would be very helpful in our investigation if you could explain in detail how far you can go with the above information. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

### What to Do If SwitchBot Lock Thumbturn Seat Seems Unstable?

Updated: Feb 28th, 2023

Applicable Products: SwitchBot Lock

The thumbturn seat of the Smart Lock body has loosened, as shown in the figure below. What should I do?

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998805319831)

This is not a product defect but an Oldham's shaft

[Coupling ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling)

that can absorb some eccentricity or misalignment and allow for shaft misalignment or eccentricity. By sliding the mating key and keyway, even fairly large torques can be transmitted.

When The SwitchBot Lock is unopened,  the thumbturn seat is fixed to the protective film. When setting up, it is recommended to remove the film once it is firmly centered and attached.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998832514583)

If you unknowingly remove it first, fix it with your finger and set it up.
