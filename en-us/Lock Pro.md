### About the "Initiating Emergency Power" Feature of SwitchBot Lock Pro

Last Updated：

2024 Apr 26

Related Products: SwitchBot Lock Pro

1. Even if your device battery is low and Lock Pro cannot support unlocking you can use its passive power supply to unlock your door in 30 seconds. This is a last resort when the battery runs out without replacing it.

Please replace the battery as soon as possible after receiving a low-power notification.

2. When the Lock Pro gets jammed because of insufficient turning force from improper installation or other reasons, even with enough battery power left, the passive power supply will work, and the SwitchBot App will show "Initiating emergency power". The passive power supply can be used up to five times. If the fifth unlocking attempt is successful, the battery power will decrease to 20% and the SwitchBot App will alert you that the Lock Pro is not compatible with your door lock.

### Introduction of Rechargeable Battery for SwitchBot Lock Pro

Last Updated: 2024 Jun 14

Related Products: SwitchBot Lock Pro

1. Both sides of the rechargeable battery A and B are powered independently of each other, and if one side runs out of battery power, the other side can continue to power the other side, and at the same time, only the one with a dead battery can be charged independently.

2. This section describes the battery drain order when using rechargeable batteries A and B at the same time. If rechargeable battery A is inserted into the Lock Pro first, the Lock Pro will switch on and start draining battery A. When A is at low power, then rechargeable battery B, which is inserted next, will relay power (and vice versa). You can also check the battery level of rechargeable batteries A and B in SwitchBot App -> Lock Pro -> Gear mark -> Firmware & Battery.

If you do not approach your home within the preset time of validity for any reason, this automatic unlocking will be deactivated. In such a case, leaving and re-entering the preset geofence can trigger a new round of auto-unlock.

Only the smartphones of the home owner and admins can trigger the Auto-Unlock function when they move within range of the Lock Pro/Lock Ultra. At this time, Auto-Unlock is not supported for members or members with limited permissions.

4. Since the auto-unlock function relies on your smartphone's GPS, Bluetooth and geofence, please enable the Wi-Fi of your smartphone and keep SwitchBot App running in the background for a better experience.

Note:

Go to your smartphone's Settings App to enable Wi-Fi.

You can experience the auto-unlock feature without a Hub.

SwitchBot Lock doesn't have the auto-unlock feature.

The auto-unlock feature is currently in beta and may have some operational instability. We appreciate your understanding.

If you are using an Android phone, please disable the battery optimization for the SwitchBot App so that the App can receive the location data required for automatic unlocking promptly.

If you activate low power mode on your smartphone, it may affect the location updates. You might need to wait a few seconds after arriving at your door for the auto unlock feature to open the door. In this situation, just unlock your phone screen before reaching your door to speed up the auto unlock trigger.

Only the smartphones of the home owner and admins (must be added to the white list) can trigger the Auto-Unlock function when they move within range of the Lock Pro. At this time, Auto-Unlock is not supported for members or members with limited permissions.

Note：

For iOS devices, if you're using the SwitchBot App and don't receive notifications at the set time, it's not a bug. This is due to a limitation with the iOS system: notifications won't be delivered if you are actively using the SwitchBot App at the time the notification is scheduled to be sent. iOS only sends app notifications when the app is running in the background or the device is locked, among other conditions. So, if you remain in the SwitchBot App when the conditions for a notification are met, you will not receive the notification.

There are no such restrictions for Android devices.
