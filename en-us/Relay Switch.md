### Can I Use SwitchBot Relay Switch to Control the Air Conditioner Remotely?

Last Updated: 2024 Oct 30

Related Product: SwitchBot Relay Switch 1, SwitchBot Relay Switch 1PM

We

do not recommend

using SwitchBot Relay Switch to control an air conditioner. Although most air conditioners operate at around 3.5A during regular use, the initial motor startup can draw a surge current between 11-18A (3-8 times the rated current).

This could activate SwitchBot Relay Switch’s overload protection

, which is triggered when currents exceed 16A.

If your goal is to measure the air conditioner’s power consumption, you can consider using SwitchBot Relay Switch 1PM, which supports this function.

### Over-Temperature Protection in SwitchBot Relay Switch

Last Updated: 2024 Oct 31

Related Product: SwitchBot Relay Switch 1, SwitchBot Relay Switch 1PM

SwitchBot Relay Switch is equipped with an over-temperature protection feature that enhances its safety and durability. If the device’s internal temperature

exceeds

100°C,

the relay will automatically disconnect the input, preventing overheating and potential damage to connected devices.

If over-temperature protection is triggered, you can reset the device by turning off the power and restarting it, which will clear the protection state.

Related Product: SwitchBot Relay Switch 1PM

SwitchBot Relay Switch 1PM

is equipped with an overload protection feature that automatically disconnects the input

if the current exceeds

16A

. This protection helps prevent overheating or potential damage by cutting power when high current levels are detected.

If overload protection is triggered, you can reset the device by turning off the power and restarting it, which will clear the protection state.

Please note that this overload protection is exclusive to the SwitchBot Relay Switch 1PM model; the

SwitchBot Relay Switch 1 does not include this feature

.

### What Does the Dry Contact on SwitchBot Relay Switch 1 Do?

Last Updated: 2024 Oct 30

Related Product: SwitchBot Relay Switch 1

A dry contact is essentially a relay that acts as an on/off switch without carrying any power itself, allowing it to connect or trigger other devices without interference or electrical risk. For

SwitchBot Relay Switch 1

, the dry contact can be easily applied to operate low-power triggers like

garage doors

and

doorbells

, allowing for remote activation of these devices. This provides a simple, flexible setup for integrating automated control in your home.
