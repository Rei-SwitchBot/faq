### Troubleshooting Slow Wireless Charging on SwitchBot Air Purifier Table

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
The wireless charging pad on the SwitchBot Air Purifier Table supports up to 15W for Android devices and 7.5W for Apple devices. However, charging times may vary depending on your smartphone model, and several factors can influence charging speed. Here are some tips to help you optimize the charging experience:
1. For the best charging performance, make sure the charging coil in your phone is properly aligned with the coil on the charging pad. Since the position of the coil varies between devices, we recommend checking your smartphone’s manual for specific alignment instructions.
2. If your phone has a protective case, especially a thicker one, it may reduce charging efficiency and result in slower charging times. Thicker cases can also cause slight heating during charging. For faster charging, try removing the case or using a thinner one.
3. If your phone case includes a metal plate (as shown in the image), it may prevent wireless charging altogether. We recommend using a case without a metal plate or removing the case entirely before placing your phone on the charging pad.

4. The time required to fully charge the battery may vary depending on the smartphone model. If the battery is able to reach full capacity, there should be no issues with the air purifier. If charging stops before reaching full capacity, please feel free to contact us.

### Troubleshooting Pet Hair Not Being Drawn into SwitchBot Air Purifier

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding the pet hair not being drawn into the Air Purifier, could you please check the following points?
1. Set the air purifier to Pet Mode, then check if it draws in air by holding a tissue near the vent as shown in the image below. If the tissue is pulled in, the unit is functioning normally.

### Troubleshooting Even When Smoking Next to SwitchBot Air Purifier, the Air Quality Continues to Show "Very Good"

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. The odor sensor is located on the back of the device. If you smoke while facing the front, the smoke may not be drawn directly into the purifier, so the reading may not update. To test the sensor, set your Air Purifier to auto mode and try either of these two options below. Check if the air quality reading changes.
- Gently introduce some dust near the sensor (lightly tapping a feather duster nearby would work)
- Direct some mist from an ultrasonic humidifier toward the sensor area
