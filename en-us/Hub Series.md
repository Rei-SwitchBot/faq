### How Long Is SwitchBot Hub 2 Charging Cable?

Updated: Mar 24th, 2023

2. Hub 2 can be connected to the cable with a

Type-C

connector, but it doesn't have a temperature/humidity sensor, so it cannot read temperature/humidity data. Therefore, we do not recommend using this cable.

### How to Add Air Conditioner by "Customize" Mode？

To add your AC, please try "Smart Learning" or "Manual Selection" first.

If "Smart Learning" and "Manual Selection" doesn't work, let's try "Customize" your AC remote. ↓↓

Every infrared command of an air conditioner remote

includes

on/off status, temperature, mode (Heat/Cool/Dehumidify/Auto) of the target device. So you cannot do button learning individually like learning TV, light etc.

To customize an air conditioner remote, you need to set the final status, temperature, mode in the App panel first, then press the button on your original remote to send the command.

For example, to learn the 'ON' command setting to cool mode at 20°C.

1) On your original remote, set the mode to cool and the temperature to 21°C. (If its temperature step is 0.5°C, you may set to '20.5°C'.)

![Image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc249a_d4e3fb1740f644579a58457cae39b10d~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_450,h_183,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cc249a_d4e3fb1740f644579a58457cae39b10d~mv2.webp)

2) On the app panel, tap ‘ON’ to start learning then set to ‘Cool’ mode and 20°C in the pop-up window.

![Image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc249a_4d12fa3a077d463587d7d8cc5091e02d~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_450,h_627,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cc249a_4d12fa3a077d463587d7d8cc5091e02d~mv2.webp)

3) Direct your original remote to the Hub Plus and press the temperature down button. The command sent out includes ‘ON’, ‘20°C’ and ‘COOL’.

![Image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc249a_82b1edbd7d2b4146886410d5c0bafdf7~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_450,h_665,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cc249a_82b1edbd7d2b4146886410d5c0bafdf7~mv2.webp)

4) The learning is done If the ‘ON’ button in the app panel turns blue.

![Image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc249a_cca268cd20334fdfbbaeef0d2483fbac~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_450,h_198,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/cc249a_cca268cd20334fdfbbaeef0d2483fbac~mv2.webp)

Congratulations, every time you press this 'ON' button it will set your air conditioner to cool mode at 20°C.

To learn the 'OFF' command, just tap the 'OFF' button on the App panel then press 'OFF' button on your original remote to learn. If there is a power button named ‘ON/OFF’ on the remote, please press the power button during the air conditioner running (so it will turn off your target device) to learn the ‘OFF’ button in the App panel.

Please note the Alexa/Google Home integration of a customized air conditioner supports 'ON' and 'OFF' commands only currently.

To add more functions, please let us know the brand and model number of your air conditioner by sending an email to

[support@switch-bot.com](mailto:support@switch-bot.com)

### How to Add Infrared Appliances to SwitchBot Hub Mini?

Last Updated: 2023 May 26

Related Products: SwitchBot Hub Mini

SwitchBot App Version: 7.0 or newer

Firmware Version: 3.9-2.6 or newer

Before registering the home appliance remote control, first, add the SwitchBot Hub Mini to the SwitchBot app.

[Embedded Content](//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2tTwpKXfOec)

* Please refer to the following because the customization mode of the air conditioner is different from the customization mode of ordinary home appliances.

[How to register the air conditioner remote control in "Customize"](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038373593-How-to-add-Air-Conditioner-by-Customize-mode-)

The learning method may differ depending on the model number of the infrared remote control, so let's use the following four learning modes and add home appliance remote controls one by one!

Well, let me guide you through the four modes of "Smart Matching(Smart Learning)", "Select Manually(Find Manufacturer)", "Learn Buttons(Customize)" and "Other".

When learning, if an error such as "learning failure 4" or "timed out" appears on the screen, there is a possibility that the corresponding button will function wirelessly instead of infrared.

When registering the remote control, bring the remote control closer to the hub mini and adjust the angle and distance from the hub mini. If the button is recognized, you will see an indication of success.

Smart Matching(Smart Learning)

Open the SwitchBot app and tap the Hub Mini icon.

Tap

Add Appliance

and choose the appliance type that you want to add.

Point the physical remote to your Hub Mini and tap "Smart Learning". Then follow the app's guide to help learn your remote's functionality.

Select Manually(Find Manufacturer)

If Smart Learning doesn't work, you can try selecting the brand and model manually.

Tap

Manual Selection

at the bottom of the learning mode page.

Choose your appliance brand and then select the corresponding model.

(Please note: if you can not find an exact number, we recommend trying a similar model as many share the same features.)

Test your remote, and save.

Manual mode still can't learn your remote? No worries, you can try

Customize

mode instead.

Learn Buttons(Customize)

Tap customize at the bottom of the

Brand

page.

Point your appliance remote at SwitchBot Hub Mini and follow the app's guide to mimic your remote's buttons.

Buttons should change to blue on your app once learning is successful.

Others

You can use this mode to program your buttons one by one and name it by feature or use an alias of your choice.

Roll down the page and choose the

Others

category.

Point your appliance remote at SwitchBot Hub Mini and follow the app's guide to mimic your remote's buttons.

Tap the "+" icon and name your button.

Tap

Start

after you name your button, and then press the remote button once when the indicator on your SwitchBot Hub Mini is off.

After receiving a message that learning is completed, tap

Test

to test your button.

If your button works, tap

Save

and continue to add other buttons.

After you have set up all buttons, tap

Save

to save this remote.

Note:

Your button alias can not be changed once set. If you need to change it, you need to delete it and set it again.

Please note: buttons set using this mode cannot be controlled directly by Alexa or Google Assistant.

Alternatively, you could create a Manual Scene via our app to control via Alexa, Google Assistant, or IFTTT. For details regarding this, please check here (Alexa) or here (Google Assistant).

### How to Set up SwitchBot Hub Mini and Notes on Router Settings

Please note:

If you want to change your Wi-Fi router, go into Advanced or Network Settings and select 'Edit' to reconfigure it.

When using the Hub Mini, always use a

5V1A/5V2A

adaptor.

Set the Hub Mini to a

2.4GHz or IPv6 network that can switch automatically to IPv4

.

Please turn on "

Access Location

". *Please allow 'Location' for the SwitchBot app to work properly.

[Embedded Content](//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2tTwpKXfOec)

(If you are a SwitchBot user already, please skip this step.)

Launch the App and tap "Sign in"on the left side menu.

Step 2. Authorize the

Bluetooth and location services

on your phone.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998201938071)

Step 3. Press and hold the button on top of Hub Mini until the indicator flashes and then tap "next." And input SSID and password. (note: 5G Wi-Fi is not supported for now). You can change the device name at the same step.

![Image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/826c4e_04c022e8b6c44234a12a27a837d50621~mv2_d_2290_1354_s_2.png/v1/fill/w_925,h_547,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/826c4e_04c022e8b6c44234a12a27a837d50621~mv2_d_2290_1354_s_2.png)

This section provides information on router settings. As the configuration method differs depending on the router model, please contact the manufacturer or provider for more information.

1. Make sure your home network does not have security features such as MAC address filtering enabled.

2. Please do the setting work near the WiFi router.

3. 5G Wi-Fi is not supported, so please use 2.4G Wi-Fi. There are two routers, 5G and 2.4G Wi-Fi, but be sure to connect to 2.4G Wi-Fi.

4. Check the security settings of your Wi-Fi router.

Wi-Fi settings (encryption method, DHCP, firewall, etc.) may be the cause.

WPA2-PEAP, WPA3-PEAP, WEP and WPS cannot be supported.

WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK is recommended.

Please make sure that your Wi-Fi router assigns an IP address to the Hub Mini - this is not a problem if you have automatic IP address acquisition (DHCP settings).

If a firewall is configured, Hub Mini may not be able to connect to the ground service. If you cannot connect, please check your firewall settings.

5. In some cases, the issue was resolved by updating the firmware of some routers to the latest version. Please make sure you have the latest version.

6. If you install a Wi-Fi repeater in your home, please make sure that the repeater mainly uses the 2.4Ghz band.

7. Mesh Wi-Fi (a type in which the router automatically switches between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz) is basically automatically connected to 2.4Ghz, so you can use it, but some WiFi routers try to connect to 5Ghz. There are cases where it may be affected, so it is rarely affected.

* The protocol and port information will be "MQTT OVER TCP PORT 8883".

If you are still unable to complete the initial setup after trying the above settings, please try Hub Mini from another network or from your mobile's personal hotspot for troubleshooting.

Please refer to the following method for personal hotspot.

How to set up personal hotspot in phone settings?

1. Select Settings > Cellular or Cellular Data or Settings > Internet Sharing.

2. Tap the slider next to Allow Others to Connect.

3. Enable Internet Sharing, then set up Hub Mini and configure Wi-Fi connection settings.

### Learn More About SwitchBot Hub

Last Updated: 2024 Aug 21

Related Products: SwitchBot Hub Mini, SwitchBot Hub Mini Matter Enabled, SwitchBot Hub 2

Using a SwitchBot Hub as a bridge

Currently, all SwitchBot products can be divided into two main categories:

Wi-Fi-integrated, these devices have a built-in Wi-Fi module, such as SwitchBot Hub 2 (Wi-Fi+BLE), SwitchBot Pan/Tilt Cam (Wi-Fi), SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S10 (Wi-Fi+BLE), SwitchBot Plug Mini (Wi-Fi+BLE).

Bluetooth-only or BLE-only (short for Bluetooth Low Energy), these devices are not connected to the internet directly, but they can be controlled directly using Bluetooth-enabled devices such as your smartphone or a SwitchBot Universal Remote (BLE-only). Bluetooth-only devices consume less power than Wi-Fi-integrated devices, but their communication range is shorter.

However, we can still connect SwitchBot Bluetooth-only devices to the internet via a SwitchBot Hub. If we have a hub under the same account and it is within communication range of the Bluetooth-only devices, we can have access to these devices through the internet.

Depending on your app version, things might look different on how you would configure your devices.

App V9.0

In this upcoming major update, it is more intuitive to enable remote access for your SwitchBot Bluetooth-only devices. You would need Beta access for this version at the moment.

Simply add a SwitchBot Hub to your account, such as Hub 2 or Hub Mini. Make sure the Bluetooth-only devices you own is nearby, preferably in the same room and not blocked out by a wall or a door.

If you are not sure the communication is good or not, you can navigate to Profile > Manage Hubs to check the coverage of each hub and tweak the placement of your hub from there.

Once your hub is all set and connected to the internet, any SwitchBot Bluetooth-only devices nearby would have access to the internet instantly.

You can control the Bluetooth-only devices with voice assistants or build some automations with IFTTT or Home Assistant. In the app, navigate to Profile > Third-party Services and connect to one or more of these services. Each of these third-party services or app usually discovers the Bluetooth-only devices automatically and syncs them to their own apps and platforms.

App V8.8 and previous versions

When using Bluetooth-only devices with a hub, you can navigate to the Settings page of your device and turn on Cloud Services to enable more device features.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998138308503)

After turning on Cloud Services, you'll be able to remotely control your device even when outside Bluetooth range. You can also control your devices using third-party smart assistants like Alexa, Google Home, Siri, and more.

When we turn on Cloud Services for SwitchBot Bluetooth devices, they will communicate with your SwitchBot Hub via Bluetooth. The Hub is also communicating with the Cloud via a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. Every time we try to control a SwitchBot Bluetooth device using our smartphone when not in Bluetooth range, the command will go to the Cloud first, and then be forwarded to your SwitchBot Hub. The Hub will tell the corresponding device what to do via Bluetooth signal when it receives the command. You can find out more by checking the image below:

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998107946391)

Controlling infrared appliances via a SwitchBot Hub

SwitchBot Hub Mini and SwitchBot Hub 2 can do more than build a network bridge for SwitchBot Bluetooth devices. There is also an Infrared receiver and emitter built inside that allows them to learn many Infrared remote control commands to enable you to use your remotes virtually via your smartphone.

Your Hub can learn the Infrared signal, and every time you try to control the corresponding infrared appliance over using your smartphone, the command will go to the Cloud first, then it will be forwarded to your SwitchBot Hub. Your Hub will then emit an infrared signal to control the corresponding appliance. You can find out more below:

### What is the difference between Infrared (IR), Bluetooth (BT), Radio Frequency (RF) remote controls of my appliances?

Since our Hub Mini, Ceiling Light remote control devices via Infrared (IR), it is NOT possible to use them for RF or Bluetooth-controlled remotes and appliances. The common formats of remote control signals are described below.

Infrared (Infrared)

Infrared is the only technology used in all of SwitchBot Hub Mini (and other Hub devices), Ceiling Light series, which use pulses of infrared light to send controller data to the appliance. Infrared is invisible to the human eye. Infrared signals do not penetrate walls, so communication is limited by distance and building materials.

To check your Hub Mini compatiblity, refer to:

[How do I know if my appliance remote is IR supported, and can be added to Hub Mini?](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/8072054481047)

Radio Frequency

Radio frequency (RF) is a data transmission technology which is based on electromagnetic radio waves. The advantage of RF is that this technology has a wider signal range. RF can go through and there is no need to point your remote to the device, as it does not require to be in line-of-sight.

Bluetooth

Bluetooth (which is a type of RF) is a wireless communication technology that uses radio waves of a specific frequency to transmit data from one device to another over short distances of up to 10 m. It is used in a variety of products, including

Amazon's Fire TV Stick

,

Roku TV Stick,

XGIMI, and many other electronics and digital devices controllers that use Bluetooth.

Since our Hub Mini control SwitchBot devices via Infrared (IR), it is not possible to use them for most of RF or Bluetooth controlled TV's or appliances.

### Troubleshooting When Using SwitchBot Hub Mini to Control Home Appliances, Other Appliances will Also Respond.

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.
Regarding this issue, could you please check the following points?
1. Please note that Hub Mini itself does not have a function to distinguish infrared rays. Use the remote control attached to home appliance A to operate home appliance B. If the remote controls supplied with the appliances are used together, check that they can be controlled separately by adjusting the position of the hub mini. If the position adjustment does not improve the situation, misoperation is now inevitable. Thanks for your understanding!
2. Please ask the original manufacturer of the appliance if there has been an infrared interference countermeasure.

### Alexa just can't get hub 2's temperature and humidity to start a routine.

We apologize for any inconvenience our product caused.
SwitchBot Hub 2 is recognized as a temperature and humidity sensor in the Alexa app. However, Alexa does not yet support using temperature and humidity data as triggers for routines. As a result, you won’t see Hub 2’s temperature or humidity as available conditions when creating Alexa Routines.
As an alternative, consider using SwitchBot, SmartThings, IFTTT or Apple Home apps. These platforms support setting temperature and humidity data, including readings from the Hub 2, as triggers for automation. This can help you create more customized routines based on environmental conditions.
If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us.
