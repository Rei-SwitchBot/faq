### Blind Tilt's Light Sensor shows different data with Solar Panel Light Sensor

Updated: Jan 30th, 2023

Applicable Products: SwitchBot Blind Tilt

It is recommended to install the SwitchBot Blind Tilt with the Switchbot logo facing indoors so the data detected by the light sensor on the device is the indoor illuminance. On the other hand, since the solar panel detects outdoor illuminance, it is natural to assume that there is a level difference in the light sensor data.

### Why do Grouped Blind Tilts drain battery faster than the single Blind Tilt?

Last Updated: 2023 June 14

Related Products: SwitchBot Blind Tilt, SwitchBot Hub Mini

SwitchBot App Version: 7.2 or newer

Firmware Version: V20 or newer

The power consumption of SwitchBot Blind Tilt increases significantly when grouped compared to a single Blind Tilt might be due to the communication between devices.

When used individually, the Blind Tilt only needs to communicate with the phone or SwitchBot Hub Mini. However, when grouped, the Blind Tilts form a link and need to communicate with each other, which increases the constant power consumption.


---
### How Can I Check the Battery Status of Sub-Devices After Grouping SwitchBot Blind Tilts?

After grouping Blind Tilt devices, only the main device will be displayed in the SwitchBot app, while sub-devices are automatically hidden. The app only shows the charging status and battery level of the main device, not the sub-devices. If you want to check the battery level of a sub-device, you’ll need to ungroup the devices first and then select the specific device individually to view its status.
