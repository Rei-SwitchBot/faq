### Is It Possible to Connect SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S20 to Home Water Pipe for Automatic Water Refill and Drainage?

Yes, if you want to connect the S20 directly to the water pipe for automatic water supply and drainage, consider using a water station (sold separately).
After installing the water station, go to SwitchBot App -> S20 -> Function -> Settings to select the water station and mark it with the robot S20.

Before cleaning different floors, please activate the "Water Station Not Marked (Beta)" feature in the SwitchBot App by going to S20 -> Vac & Mop.

### Can I Use SwitchBot Floor Cleaning Robot S20 Overseas?

The S20 robot has region-specific voltage specifications:
- Japan: 100V~ 50/60Hz
- North America: 120V~ 60Hz
- Europe: 220–240V~ 50/60Hz
- Taiwan: 120V~ 60Hz

To safely use your S20 abroad, you need to buy a model that matches the voltage of your destination or use a voltage transformer with your current unit. Failure to convert the voltage properly could cause the vacuum's auto-empty station to short-circuit.

Note:
If you plan to bring the robot vacuum cleaner on a plane, check with the airline or airport staff about its built-in lithium battery.
