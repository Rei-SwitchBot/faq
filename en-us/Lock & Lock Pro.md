Related Products: SwitchBot Lock Pro

1. Even if your device battery is low and Lock Pro cannot support unlocking you can use its passive power supply to unlock your door in 30 seconds. This is a last resort when the battery runs out without replacing it.

Please replace the battery as soon as possible after receiving a low-power notification.

2. When the Lock Pro gets jammed because of insufficient turning force from improper installation or other reasons, even with enough battery power left, the passive power supply will work, and the SwitchBot App will show "Initiating emergency power". The passive power supply can be used up to five times. If the fifth unlocking attempt is successful, the battery power will decrease to 20% and the SwitchBot App will alert you that the Lock Pro is not compatible with your door lock.

You can also check the battery level of rechargeable batteries A and B in SwitchBot App -> Lock Pro -> Gear mark -> Firmware & Battery.

### Is It Possible to Install SwitchBot Lock on a Steel Door?

Last Updated: 2023 July 28

Related Products: SwitchBot Lock

1. SwitchBot Lock is equipped with a magnetic sensor. Should you install this device onto a steel door, the Auto-Lock function may cease to work.

2. SwitchBot Lock may be affixed to your door using double-sided tape. In some living environments, you may find problems may occur, such as the double-sided tape peeling causing SwitchBot Lock to fall off due to thermal expansion and contraction.

3. The coating on steel doors may prevent your device from being attached securely using double-sided tape.

4. To prevent such issues, you may want to:

※Attach your SwitchBot Lock to your door using screws.

※Ensure your device is used in a temperature environment that ranges between 15°C to 35°C.

### SwitchBot Lock Pro's Auto-Unlock (Beta) Feature

Last Updated: 2024 Sep 02

Related Product: SwitchBot Lock Pro

SwitchBot App Version: 8.8 or newer

2. Enable the auto-unlock feature in the following order:

Launch SwitchBot App and log in.

Tap your Lock Pro.

Tap the gear icon in the upper right corner.

Tap Auto-Unlock (Beta) on the settings screen.

Enable the Auto-Unlock (Beta) and agree the precautions.

Set the valid period. (the default setting is 10 mins).

Note:

At this time, you must be added to the whitelist to experience this feature, please contact us via SwitchBot App > Profile > Support/Help & Feedback >Feedback.

3. With the settings above, when your smartphone enters the preset geofence range from outside, SwitchBot App will start scanning your Lock Pro via Bluetooth. Upon arriving home*, your phone will automatically establish a Bluetooth connection with the Lock Pro and enable it to unlock and open your door. If you do not approach your home within the preset time of validity for any reason, this automatic unlocking will be deactivated. In such a case, leaving and re-entering the preset geofence can trigger a new round of auto-unlock.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998259341847)

Note: Regarding "arriving home," it pertains to the Bluetooth connection range of Lock Pro, which is typically within a few meters from the door lock. However, this range can be influenced by factors such as door and wall materials, as well as other interferences.

4. Since the auto-unlock function relies on your smartphone's GPS, Bluetooth and geofence, please enable the Wi-Fi of your smartphone and keep SwitchBot App running in the background for a better experience.

5. If you have any questions, please contact us via SwitchBot App > Profile > Help & Feedback >Feedback.

Note:

Go to your smartphone's Settings App to enable Wi-Fi.

You can experience the auto-unlock feature without a Hub.

SwitchBot Lock doesn't have the auto-unlock feature.

The auto-unlock feature is currently in beta and may have some operational instability. We appreciate your understanding.

If you are using an Android phone, please disable the battery optimization for the SwitchBot App so that the App can receive the location data required for automatic unlocking promptly.

If you activate low power mode on your smartphone, it may affect the location updates. You might need to wait a few seconds after arriving at your door for the auto unlock feature to open the door. In this situation, just unlock your phone screen before reaching your door to speed up the auto unlock trigger.

Only the smartphones of the home owner and admins (must be added to the white list) can trigger the Auto-Unlock function when they move within range of the Lock Pro. At this time, Auto-Unlock is not supported for members or members with limited permissions.

Note：

For iOS devices, if you're using the SwitchBot App and don't receive notifications at the set time, it's not a bug. This is due to a limitation with the iOS system: notifications won't be delivered if you are actively using the SwitchBot App at the time the notification is scheduled to be sent. iOS only sends app notifications when the app is running in the background or the device is locked, among other conditions. So, if you remain in the SwitchBot App when the conditions for a notification are met, you will not receive the notification.

There are no such restrictions for Android devices.

### What Should I Pay Attention to When Fixing SwitchBot Lock With Double Sided Tape?

Last Updated: 2024 May 31

Related products: SwitchBot Lock

1. Make sure there is enough space between your door lock and SwitchBot Lock.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/23858334908567)

Please note: This device is not suitable for installation in areas that may include gaps or cracks.

2. Make sure your installation surface is flat and dry.

The recommended operating environment for 3M adhesive is 15°C to 35°C.

Please do not install your adhesive in any environments that contain moisture.

Do not install on uneven surfaces.

Please clean your installation surface with an alcohol swab before beginning.

If your installation surface is smooth like a mirror, an extra adhesive may be required.

If your door lock makes it more difficult to install SwitchBot Lock due to its design or other reasons. Please contact us to see if there are any Mounting Plate accessories that we can provide you with.

3. When installing on surfaces that might have wallpaper, please make sure there are no bulges present and that your installation surface is smooth and flat.

4. The adhesiveness of double-sided tape may easily deteriorate if installed near heat sources.

※Related Posts:

6. When replacing double-sided tape, please ensure you remove the old double-sided tape cleanly before replacing it. If old residue from double-sided tape is left on your mounting surface, it may weaken the adhesive strength when re-installing, causing your device to fall down once mounted.

8. Please allow 24 hours for the product to be firmly fixed before using.

### What to Do If My SwitchBot Lock Gets Jammed?

Last Updated: 2024 Jun 20

Related Products: SwitchBot Lock

Firmware Version: 6.8 or newer

1. If you are locked out and can not enter your home, please check to see if you can use the emergency unlock function to unlock your door.

*

Please be sure to bring the key with you when you leave the house

in case the battery runs out or the lock itself does not work. If the emergency lock doesn't help you resolve your issue and a lock-opening service is required, we will not be responsible for your lock-opening service fee. Thanks for your understanding.

2. If you are at home, please check that the center of the thumbturn of the lock is coaxial with the center of the knob with respect to installation. If it is not aligned correctly, your SwitchBot Lock may be subjected to excessive rotational force to locking and unlocking. If your SwitchBot Lock is used for a long time in this condition, it may get jammed, or the device itself may fall.

※ Image showing the coaxial installation position of SwitchBot Lock.

※I mages showing installation where position not coaxial

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998493149463)

3. If the fixed tail on the lock body has been removed, please manually fix the joint slider and adjust the center of the knob and the center of the lock thumbturn to a coaxial position, as shown in the video below, before reinstalling your SwitchBot Lock again.

※Related Post:

[What should I do if the thumbturn seat loosens?](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/6164391849751)

4. If you are purchasing a new Lock, please install it as shown in the video below.

https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uzOVKj5P6s

※If the installation adjustment successfully resolves your jamming issue, you will not need to do anything else.

===============================================================

5. After reconfirming installation, remove SwitchBot Lock from the mounting adapter and try to operate the lock (or emergency unlocking) function using our app.

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998506480535)

6. If the lock does not turn when operating via our app, please log in to your SwitchBot account and navigate to

Profile → Feedback

and leave feedback containing a video of your SwitchBot Lock not turning. We will provide after-sales warranty service to help you resolve your issue (replacement of new device and collection of your defective device).

========================================================

7. If your lock turns normally when using our app to operate, this usually means the issue is not with SwitchBot Lock itself. Please log into SwitchBot App -> Profile -> Help and Feedback -> Feedback to submit a request for firmware update.

8. Please reinstall and calibrate your SwitchBot Lock once your update is complete, and make sure that the battery used is CR123A 3V/1500mAh and that there is sufficient remaining battery power. A low battery level will affect the rotational force of the Lock.

*Related Post:

[Battery issue inquiry for the SwitchBot product](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/9744936851863)

※You can use the following guide to check the firmware and battery level of your SwitchBot Lock. Open our app > Tap your device > Tap the

9. Please open the door, unlock the lock with the SwitchBot App, and check if it is jammed.

9-1>If the lock cannot handle the front door lock at this time due to jamming, please contact us by logging in to the SwitchBot App → Profile → Feedback. When contacting us, please provide a video of the jamming.

9-2>If the jamming is not occurring, please close the door and lock it with the SwitchBot App. If the door can be locked without any problem, it appears that the front door lock can be handled by the rotational force of the lock. If you experience a jam when locking, the door may not be closing properly, and the latch may be hitting the door frame. Please check the door opening and closing condition again before locking. If you still experience the jamming, please take a video of the jamming in the closed state and contact us by logging in to the SwitchBot App → Profile → Feedback. We will respond with a refund or return as soon as possible.

10. If you are still experiencing the Jammed even with the lastest firmware, even though there is no problem with rotational force, please contact us with a video of the jamming by logging in to the SwitchBot App -> Profile -> Feedback.

This is a complicated troubleshooting process.

When you contact us, it would be very helpful in our investigation if you could explain in detail how far you can go with the above information. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

### What to Do If SwitchBot Lock Thumbturn Seat Seems Unstable?

Updated: Feb 28th, 2023

Applicable Products: SwitchBot Lock

The thumbturn seat of the Smart Lock body has loosened, as shown in the figure below. What should I do?

![Image](https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/article_attachments/25998805319831)

This is not a product defect but an Oldham's shaft

[Coupling ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling)

that can absorb some eccentricity or misalignment and allow for shaft misalignment or eccentricity. By sliding the mating key and keyway, even fairly large torques can be transmitted.

When The SwitchBot Lock is unopened,  the thumbturn seat is fixed to the protective film. When setting up, it is recommended to remove the film once it is firmly centered and attached.

If you unknowingly remove it first, fix it with your finger and set it up.

If the lock is still jammed after the installation as described above, please troubleshoot according to the related posts below.
